","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Programs are available for all residents of Albuquerque connected to the ABCWUA potable water system with specialized programs for low-income residents. Conservation offers to customers enrolled in the Low Income Assistance Credit Program (~800 per year) include monthly high consumption notices, follow up calls to walk them through leak detection or high consumption questions such as how to best save water outdoors, on-site leak and water efficiency audits, and connecting folks with other partners program that offer indoor water conservation kits.

For all customers we offer rebates for high efficiency washing machines ($100 rebate) for indoors, targeted leak audits and irrigation consultations, monthly newsletter reaching to 56,000 residents, performance based Large Water Use Customized Rebate Program and see attachments for our big focus area rebates. This portfolio of rebates was launched between 2019 and 2020.  

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority is improving energy efficiency and resiliency to climate change by implementing renewable energy projects at the production and reclamation plants, the largest sources of energy. Currently, 15% of total energy generation comes from solar and biogas renewable. 11% of the total energy used for treatment and pumping at the Water Treatment Plant comes from solar energy. 24% of the total wastewater reclamation system energy use is from renewable energy. ABCWUA uses operational dedicated funding to improve system energy resiliency and efficiency. Yearly goals and objectives for energy efficiency projects are developed to continually augment our renewable energy portfolio.

The Water Authority solar arrays generate 7.5 MW in electricity for its two treatment plants (drinking water and wastewater). The renewable energy produced by these facilities, plus participation in the local energy utility’s peak electrical demand response program, saves about $2 million annually. Twenty percent of the energy needs at these two plants are achieved through on-site solar arrays. A solar array is planned to be installed near the San Juan-Chama Raw Water Pump Station in 2023 offsetting 30% of the energy needs at the pump station. The solar arrays will provide a total of about 10 MW in electricity. Solar power is obtained through power purchase agreements ensuring no long-term costs to the Water Authority.

Additionally, the Water Authority recently completed a study to look at feasibility and possible benefits of incorporating Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOG) collected commercially to increase biogas energy generation while simultaneously addressing an ongoing operation and maintenance issue of FOG in the wastewater.

The energy and water utilities do not currently offer joint water and energy efficiency programs to customers, but Texas Gas Service does offer free water-saving kits to residential customers and direct installation measures including low-flow showerheads and faucet aerators to commercial customers through CLEAResult. In addition, Austin implements tiered water pricing and offers rebates for residential customers such as WaterWise landscaping, rainwater harvesting, free shower heads, and other products and actions. There are also rebates available for businesses including rainwater harvesting and commercial process rebates.

In 2014, Austin’s city council adopted a goal to reduce total water use to 140 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) and residential water use to 85 gallons per capita per day by 2024. Austin Water’s multi-faceted conservation program coupled with a strong response by Austin residents has the utility on track to meet or exceed those goals. In 2018, total water use was 124 GPCD. In November 2018, Austin City Council adopted Water Forward, an integrated water resource plan that includes a suite of demand- and supply-side options to address Austin’s water needs over the next 100 years and ensure long-term water availability through a variety of climate conditions. The Water Forward plan includes a 2025 target of 6,970 AF of additional water savings from demand management strategies (including onsite reuse).

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

 

Austin Water looks to both operational optimization and capital improvements to address energy efficiency at the facility, process, and system levels. Examples include: 1) evaluating energy usage and expanding the Building Automation System to additional building facilities to allow for centralized control of HVAC, lighting, and other electrical systems, and help with reducing peak energy demand, 2) initiating a secondary process improvement project one of its wastewater treatment plants, which is anticipated to reduce energy use once complete, 3) evaluating energy savings resulting from water conservation initiatives (which save over 8 billion gallons of water per year) & considering opportunities to extend incentive programs, and 4) enrolling in the DOE’s Sustainable Wastewater Infrastructure Accelerator 2.0.

Approximately one third of the biogas produced by the Hornsby Bend Biosolids Management Plant’s anaerobic digestion process is utilized in a Combined Heat & Power system. This largely offsets the plant’s energy use and reduces the amount of digester gas being flared. Austin Water has a study underway to determine best approaches for better utilizing the biogas and reducing flaring. Last Updated: August 2023

While Baltimore does not have a formal green fleet procurement strategy, the 2019 Baltimore Sustainability Plan includes among its energy actions to ""Set a goal to reduce petroleum consumption and increase use of alternative fuel vehicles and equipment in the city government fleet."" In 2021, City Council Bill 21-0159 Procurement - Zero Emission Vehicles was introduced, but it has not been adopted. The City is working to reduce vehicle fuel consumption by lowering the average age of the fleet, by replacing older vehicles with newer and more efficient vehicles. In 2020 and 2021, the City is purchasing 19 battery electric vehicles. In 2020, Baltimore purchased 25 Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) Ford Escapes and 50 Ford Explore Hybrid Pursuit vehicles. Baltimore's municipal fleet is currently composed of 0.41% efficient vehicles, including hybrid and battery electric vehicles.? 

Public Lighting

The Baltimore Complete Streets Manual, adopted in 2021, includes lighting guidelines which specify that figure selection should meet the recommendations of CIE 126-1997, Guidelines for Minimizing Sky Glow, and specify that programmable lighting should be set so that lights are dimmed or completely extinguished when sufficient daylight is available. Baltimore has converted 75% of streetlights to LED. All traffic lights have been changed to LEDs. 

Inclusive procurement 

Article 5, Subtitle 28 (Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises; Small Local Business Enterprises) of the Baltimore City code requires that the Minority and Women’s Business Opportunity Office (WBOO) establish appropriate MBE and WBE participation goals on each specific City contract, including energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. City agencies are responsible for tracking their agency’s contract compliance and submitting those reports to MWBOO. The City’s most recent energy efficiency project to install LED lights at a Filtration plant had a MBWE requirement of 30%. The City’s current RFP for an off-site renewable power purchasing agreement has an MBWE goal of 30%. The Minority and Women's Business Opportunity Office released the 2022 Disparity Study, which analyzed whether a disparity exists between the number of available MBEs, WBEs, VBEs, DOBEs, and LGBTQs providing goods or services and the number who are contracting with the City as a prime contractor or subcontractor. The Disparity Study details a growth in overall City spending, specific growth in several contracting areas from the 2014 Report, the majority of spending is with local City businesses, and the positive steps that the City has undertaken to increase M/WBE participation and eliminate disparities. The Report makes several recommendations that serve as a roadmap to ensure that we are eliminating any barriers to entry for M/WBEs.

","Fleet Policies and Composition

Boston has released a Zero Emission Vehicle Roadmap, adopting new goals and strategies to support vehicle electrification. The Roadmap presents a goal that 100% light-duty vehicles be emissions-free by 2035, 100% of medium-duty vehicles by 2050, and 100% of heavy-duty vehicles by 2060. Boston also has established a motor pool, FleetHub, using car-sharing technology, allowing the city to reduce the fleet size and maximize the use of existing stock. Additionally, Boston Public Schools has made significant efforts to increase school bus routing efficiency and replace the oldest, least efficient diesel school buses with cleaner propane vehicles. Collectively, these efforts have led to 2,650,824 fewer miles driven by Boston Public School diesel buses. Boston’s fleet is composed of 18% efficient vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles. 

Public Lighting

The Streetlight Division of the Public Works Department maintains streetlights across Boston. Thousands of these streetlights are ""dark-sky friendly"" meaning that 95% of the light shoots down instead of up in the sky and they have 1,600 control boxes that help adjust the outdoor lighting. In addition, Lights Out Boston is a voluntary program under which participating building owners agree to turn off or dim all architectural lighting between 11 pm and 5 am during the fall migratory bird season. Smart Streetlights is an infrastructure project to increase safety and energy savings by installing technologies capable of reducing carbon emissions and operational costs, heat and pollution sensors, and intelligent and adaptable lighting. There are 70,992 streetlights in Boston; since 2010 the City of Boston has been converting streetlights to LED technology. As of August 2023, 86% of Boston's streetlights are LED.

Inclusive procurement 

The City of Boston has inclusive procurement contract processes. The City of Boston will make it a goal to utilize at least 25% minority- and women-owned businesses across all contracts awarded in any fiscal year, with a goal of 15% utilization for woman-owned businesses and a goal of 10% utilization for minority-owned businesses. Under the Executive Order, all City Departments procuring goods or services must consult with the Certified Business Directory and identify at least one certified business that is minority or women owned that customarily performs or supplies the relevant work to include as part of the solicitation process for each of its procurements. To ensure that departments are complying with the Executive Order, they are required to fill out an Equitable Procurement Form to certify that they consulted with the Directory and to document whether they identified a certified business in the industry from which they are seeking to procure a good or service. Departments must submit one form for every procurement that they intend to issue. They have applied these processes to all projects, including energy projects. In 2020, Boston released a disparity study conducted by BBC Research & Consulting. Companies that are working with the City of Boston must meet certain standards that make sure companies are giving residents with a criminal record a fair chance of getting hired.

","Building Benchmarking

In accordance with the 2013 Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, Boston uses Energy Star Portfolio Manager to benchmark energy use in 100% of its municipal buildings. Boston makes all municipal utility billing data available through Analyze Boston, the city’s open data portal. Boston also makes real-time 5- and 15-minute interval data on the city’s largest facilities available publicly through Analyze Boston.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategy 

Renew Boston Trust (RBT) is the City's self-financing, strategic program that conducts energy audits and invests in conservation upgrades for municipal buildings. RBT currently has three phases, each phase targets a unique set of municipal buildings and in 2022 RBT extended its scope to include an energy audit of all exterior City-own lighting. Between July 2021 and June 2022, the equipment installed in Phase 1 of RBT saved $681,185. The majority of Phase 2 installations are completed and the City is seeing savings in energy and dollars. Finally, Phase 3 lighting, water, and building envelope upgrades in schools will be completed. For the Fiscal Year 2023, that runs between July 1st 2022 to June 30th 2023, the funding included dollars for Energy Efficiency and Design, Exterior Lighting, RBT Phase II, and RBT Phase III.

Municipal Employee Transportation Benefits 

The City of Boston offers the MBTA Pass Program in which employees can have the cost deducted from their payroll before taxes. In addition to that, the City of Boston offers Bluebikes Memberships with a range of benefits dependent on employment type.

","Equity-Driven Community Engagement

Boston has conducted community engagement for several of its clean energy initiatives. Mayor Wu's Neighborhood Coffee Hour is a community engagement that gives residents the chance to speak with the Mayor and staff from various City departments about open space and their neighborhoods. The Environment Department has participated in this event engaged residents on both Boston Community Choice Electricity and Mass Save Programs. The city also conducted a webinar available in 12 different languages including American Sign Language Interpretation for its Community Choice Electricity program.

For the development of the building emissions performance standard, the City worked with One Square World (facilitation experts) and Alternatives for Community and Environment (local frontline community-based environmental justice organization), using a model of collaborative governance, to convene a resident advisory group, co-equal in importance to a technical advisory group. Goals included minimizing harm (displacement, environmental health, energy costs) and maximizing benefits and opportunities (building comfort and health, jobs, air quality, fair housing, transparency) for residents impacted by the policy. One Square World and ACE worked with three community partner organizations - Chinese Progressive Association, New England United for Justice and City Life/Vida Urbana - identified due to their presence and trusted status in communities likely to be impacted, such as Chinatown. Their organizers were engaged to recruit residents who live in large multifamily buildings and who would be directly affected by the ordinance. The resident advisory group met three times to shared their lived experiences, determine community priorities for the ordinance and share feedback that directly informed the policy's development and design. All meeting and outreach materials were translated into key languages, with systematic meeting interpretation in Cantonese, as well as interpretation in Spanish and Taishanese as requested.

While not involving a direct dialogue between relevant decision-makers and residents, the city's 2019 Climate Action Plan Update included a process of public engagement conducted in partnership with local community-based organizations. A street team composed of members of target stakeholder groups for outreach (youth, low-income individuals, people of color, and those with limited-English proficiency) conducted outreach at local neighborhood events, with materials available in all 6 of Boston’s main languages (English, Haitian Creole, Cape Verdean Creole, Chinese, Portuguese, Vietnamese).

Equity-Driven Decision-Making

We were unable to determine if the city has created a formal role for marginalized community residents or local organizations representing those communities to participate in decision-making that affects the creation or implementation of a local energy, sustainability, or climate action plan.

Though limited in scope to only specific initiatives, the city sometimes provides a formal role in decision-making for marginalized communities. One example is its ""collaborative governance"" approach to developing a building emissions performance standard, which aims to collaborate with and center communities that would be most affected by the policy. This project team includes Alternatives for Community & Environment (ACE, an environmental justice organization) and One Square World, which has gathered a group of community members. The project team is co-creating the stakeholder engagement plan with (compensated) community partners that represent traditionally marginalized communities.

","Low-Income Programs

The state of Massachusetts is served by the Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN), which is a network of Community Action Agencies, public and private housing owners, government organizations and public utilities that work together to provide low-income efficiency solutions in the state. Through LEAN, National Grid and Eversource participate in the dual fuel Income Eligible Coordinated Delivery Core Initiative (formerly Low-Income Single Family and Low-Income Multi-Family), which serves customers at or below 60% of the state median income level for 1–4-unit buildings or buildings with 5+ units that have 50% of units are at or below 60% AMI. The initiative offers no cost measures such as lighting and smart strips, appliance replacement, water saving measures, insulation and air sealing, and heating system replacement.

Community Action Program (CAP) agencies also leverage additional funding from the Department of Energy and DHCD for heating systems and health and safety repairs. CAPs leverage utility funds and WAP funds for repairs of health and safety measures such as knob and tube removal, asbestos removal, combustion safety, mold and moisture remediation, roof repair, pest remediation and others. Additionally, the City of Boston Credit Union became a Mass Save HEAT Loan Participating Lender by offering customers the opportunity to apply for 0% loans for the installation of qualified energy efficient improvements.

Through the Mass Save Community First Partnership, Eversource and National Grid are providing up to $60k/year for 3 years to implement energy efficiency outreach with a focus on renters, those with limited English proficiency, low- to moderate-income residents, and small businesses in the Environmental Justice neighborhoods of Boston.In 2021, according to Eversource, it achieved 142,842 MWh in energy savings, while spending $30,567,314 on its low-income programs and serving 12,366 low-income customers. In 2021, National Grid achieved 1.66 MMtherms in energy savings, while spending $34,604,006 on its low-income programs and served 8,291 households.

Multifamily Programs 

Both Eversource and National Grid offer a Residential Coordinated Delivery initiative. The goal is to deliver a seamless experience and maximum energy savings to every customer, regardless of unit type or ownership structure. Residential Coordinated Delivery includes services to single-family homes, including free-standing town homes, smaller multi-unit buildings, such as those with three stories or less, and larger multi-unit buildings, such as those with four stories or more, or with a centralized heating system.

The Residential Coordinated Delivery initiative creates greater flexibility for customized paths for larger or more complex multi-unit buildings, with custom incentives and savings methodologies that allow program administrators to best capture the unique opportunities of larger and mixed-use multi-family structures. Using a more customized approach for the complex multi-unit properties also allows program administrators to provide property owners with a tailored business case that makes energy efficiency upgrades for residents an easier decision. This comprehensive initiative offers energy assessments that identify all cost-effective efficiency improvement or replacement opportunities regardless of fuel source for market rate properties with four or more dwellings. Utilizing a “whole facility” approach, the assessments focus on a facility's thermal envelope (shell insulation and air leakage conditions) as well as lighting and mechanical systems.

The program also assesses in-unit savings potential for tenants. Improvements that may be eligible for incentives include lighting upgrades/controls, occupancy sensors, water heating equipment, domestic hot water measures, programmable thermostats, insulation, air sealing, heating and cooling equipment upgrades/controls, ENERGY STAR appliances and other improvements as determined on a site-specific basis. Eligible measures for the program include insulation, air sealing, light fixtures, and hot water and heating equipment, as well as heating and cooling equipment, air compressors, and energy management systems.

In 2021, Eversource saved 12,610 MWh from its multifamily programs, while spending $16,315,962 and served 9,911 housing units. In 2021, National Grid saved 1.3 MMtherms from its multifamily programs, while spending $89,000,000. Customer data was not available for National Grid.

Eversource has automated systems in place for aggregating multitenant/multifamily buildings in Eastern Massachusetts to support the Building Energy Reporting Disclosure Ordinance in Boston.. National Grid provides technical assistance for ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager, which includes assistance collecting proper data and entering in facility information.

Boston collects and shares data on electricity and natural gas consumption for residential, commercial, and municipal buildings/infrastructure available for the past five years through their Greenhouse Gas and Energy Inventory Page. The city also provides community wide energy usage information for planning and evaluation purposes through their Community Choice Electricity (CCE) municipal program. Through the City of Boston Municipal Aggregation program (Community Choice Electricity), Boston has access to the electricity consumption of 200,000+ residential, commercial, industrial, and public sector customers (received monthly). This data can be used for community planning and the evaluation of future public awareness and energy investment decisions.

The City of Boston actively advocates for policies requiring utilities to expand the availability and granularity of energy usage data through the Building Energy Reduction Disclosure Ordinance (BERDO) and its membership with the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which has a seat on the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council, and through requests to the state legislature.

While BWSC does not directly issue rebates and incentives under the MassSave program, Boston’s energy utilities—National Grid and Eversource Energy—do offer rebates and incentives for water saving technologies. Notably, Boston customers are offered no-cost water-efficiency kits that include kitchen and bathroom faucet aerators, low-flow replacement showerheads, water-efficiency gauges to test showerheads and sinks, and dye tablets to check for toilet leaks.

Although no community-wide water savings target have been adopted by the city or its utilities, the MWRA has a comprehensive, long-term strategy for water savings as described in their 2013 Water System Master Plan. This plan was updated in 2018.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Through the BWSC 2021-2023 Capital Improvement Program, BWSC has committed to maintaining and improving the water distribution and collection systems including an aggressive renewable and replacement program, reducing unaccounted water, encouraging conservation, and improving the environment. A few of their main projects outlined are the Water Main Replacement Program, Sewer and Drain Replacement Project, and the implement Stormwater/Green Infrastructure Program designed to improve water quality.

All of the wastewater that is collected by BWSC is conveyed to the MWRA Deer Island Treatment Plant in the Boston Harbor. This treatment plant uses methane, which is a byproduct of the treatment process, to power a steam turbine generator and this produces half of the electricity used at the facility. In addition to that, the steam produced also generates heat which is used throughout the facility. This plan also produces electricity through two wind turbines, solar arrays, and hydroelectric assets. In 2020, MRWA self-generated 35.4 million kWh from these resources.

NYSERDA offers the EmPower New York program to qualified low-income residential National Grid customers. This program addresses both electric and natural gas end uses, while providing no-cost energy efficiency solutions including air sealing, insulation, replacement of inefficient refrigerators and freezers, water efficiency measures, thermostats, and new energy-efficient lighting in order to reduce energy consumption. Additionally, the EmPower program includes health and safety checks of smoke detectors and appliances. Households that receive HEAP benefits, utility bill payment assistance, or participate in the federal Weatherization Assistance Program are automatically eligible. NYSERDA’s Multifamily Performance Program and RetrofitNY initiatives also have low-income saving components. See the next section for more information. 



According to ACEEE analysis, in 2019, according to NSYERDA, their low-income programs for National Grid and National Fuel Gas achieved 3,031 MWh and 0.10 MMtherms savings across National Grid’s service territory. Spending and customers served were not available. 



Multifamily Programs 



NYSERDA’s Multifamily Performance Program provides incentives for owners to incorporate energy efficiency into affordable buildings for National Grid customers. A Multifamily Building Solutions Provider will work with the owner to evaluate the building’s systems holistically, creating a customized plan aimed at generating a minimum of 20% source energy savings along with reduced energy bills. For projects that could reach deeper energy savings, the High-Performance Component targets a minimum of 40% source energy savings with a maximum post-construction source energy use intensity (EUI) of 100 kBtu/sq ft./yr. 



In 2018, NYSERDA launched the RetrofitNY initiative. The goal of this program is to drive market transformation by industrializing and standardizing the design and construction processes to achieve deep levels of cost compression, which will drive large scale adoption of deep energy and net zero retrofits in multifamily buildings. RetrofitNY approaches retrofits from a whole building perspective and targets multiple health and resiliency benefits as associated outcomes of building work-scope. NYSERDA funds are used in conjunction with other subsidy and financing offered from local, state and federal sources as a financing package coordinated through relevant affordable housing agencies.??? 



In addition to the NYSERDA programs, National Grid offers a multifamily program that provides no cost direct install of high-efficiency showerheads, faucet aerators, and thermostatic radiator valves. It also provides rebates for high efficiency natural gas heating and water heating, insulation, programmable thermostats, boiler reset controls, steam traps, and custom efficiency measures.

The CBI program promotes diversity, inclusion, and local business opportunities in the City’s contracting and procurement process for Minority, Women, and Small Business Enterprises (MWSBEs) with a significant business presence in the Charlotte Combined Statistical Area (CSA). One example of this policy’s application to energy projects is recent procurement for Electric vehicle supply equipment and related services. Charlotte put the RFP on Early Bird, the listing active and in development contracting opportunities for the City. They worked with the Charlotte Business Inclusion Team to set a goal for MWSBE participating; the subcontracting goal for this project has been set at 7%. Charlotte conducted a disparity study released in 2022, which details a timeline and plan for implementing the study’s recommendations. The City of Charlotte is limited by state law in that the city cannot set the terms of employment for its vendors/contractors. However, the city screens its contractors through its solicitation process whether it be via bid, RFP, RFQ, etc. to ensure that they contract with high quality employers.

Additionally, the city is in the process of procuring energy management software which will automate the tracking and analysis of energy use across all city facilities, enabling more frequent review of energy performance.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategies

The City of Charlotte takes a strategic approach to managing energy use in municipal facilities with a focus on making continual energy efficiency improvements. Charlotte passed an updated Sustainable Facilities Policy, which focuses on energy efficiency retrofits and prioritizing benchmarking. The revised Sustainable Facilities Policy (SFP) is intended to direct City departments to design, construct, and operate City buildings in a manner aligned with stated 2030 Strategic Energy Action Plan goals. On an annual cycle, the City will utilize benchmarking outcomes to identify the least energy-efficient facilities and the facilities with the largest potential for carbon reduction and take data-driven steps to address energy inefficiencies. A Focus on Efficiency report will be prepared each fiscal year that highlights the bottom quartile of buildings based on energy performance. Then each building in the bottom quartile will be reviewed and assigned to one of three action categories: (1) Retro-Commissioning, which requires a budget request for retro-commissioning to be performed the following fiscal year, (2) Capital Project Integration, or (3) Deferred Action.

Municipal Employee Transportation Benefits 

Charlotte provides employees a couple of options to obtain a significantly discounted or free unlimited transit pass. Employees may either purchase the pass for a reduced price or obtain the pass at no cost if the employee opts to give up their parking space.

","Utility Climate Mitigation Goal

In 2018, Exelon, the parent company of ComEd, announced a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its internal operations by 15% by 2022 from a 2015 baseline. To achieve this goal, Exelon will need to reduce emissions by 4.2% annually from 2018 levels.

City-Led Efforts to Decarbonize the Electric Grid

Under Mayor Lor Lightfoot’s leadership, the City is working to move forward equitable, affordable, and resilient clean energy for the city through its choice and negotiations with its electricity delivery franchise authority. The City anticipates moving to the next stage of its franchising process in late 2021. That stage of the process will include an energy and equity agreement that establishes environmental and consumer objectives for the city, which includes climate and energy clean targets.

In February 2021, the City of Chicago submitted public comments in support for amending the Illinois Commerce Commission’s interconnection rules to support community solar project and distributed generation and energy storage systems. The city requested that the Commission center decisions around cost-mitigation for Black, Latinx, and low-income communities, transparency in grid planning, and flexibility for the future.

In 2019, Mayor Lori Lightfoot endorsed the proposed Illinois Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA), which would continue to strengthen renewable energy goals statewide, calling on the governor and state legislature to pass this bill. As of June 2021, CEJA was still in the legislative process.

Chicago has been a key partner in ComEd's Community of the Future program, targeting the Bronzeville area of Chicago. The project includes a microgrid, and several pilots and programs to create a smarter and more connected community. As part of the microgrid, the City, the Chicago Housing Authority, and ComEd partnered to add 700 kW of solar panels on a public housing facility called Dearborn Homes.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Although Chicago’s water and energy utilities do not run joint water and energy efficiency programs, Chicago’s city-run MeterSave program provides significant incentives to the community. Through the MeterSave program, the city’s Department of Water Management (DWM) supplies a free water meter to unmetered residents and business customers and guarantees bills will be lower than the estimated rate for 7 years post installation. The City of Chicago also offers rain barrels and indoor or outdoor conservation kits to homeowners. In addition, both energy utilities offer water efficiency measures in their energy efficiency programs. For example, the ComEd Energy Efficiency Program includes measures such as low flow aerators, low flow showerheads, pre-rinse spray valves, clothes washers, and dishwashers. Peoples Gas also provides showerheads, faucet aerators, and pre rinse sprayers free of charge to commercial and residential customers via gas utility-only direct install programs (DI), kits programs (low income, non low income, and small business kits programs) and weatherization programs, as well as through electric and gas utility jointly offered low income weatherization programs.

The City of Chicago has a goal to decrease water use by 2% annually, according to the Sustainable Chicago 2015 plan. The City of Chicago also has a program to aggressively replace old water mains, thus reducing water loss from leaking pipes. Through Building a New Chicago, DWM is replacing 900 miles of water main—most of which are over 100 years old—over a 10-year period. DWM has now installed more than 135,000 meters on homes since 2001. By City ordinance, commercial buildings are required to install their own during construction. The City has now replaced over 550 miles of water main under its current capital program and will meet its goal of replacing 900 miles by 2021.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Both the Department of Water Management (DWM) and Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) have extensive programs to increase energy efficiency across operations and are pursuing energy efficiency initiatives. DWM is converting several steam-powered turbines and boilers at five pumping stations in the water distribution system to electricity, saving more than $6.4 million/year in energy costs, with additional savings from lower operating costs, and a greenhouse gas emission reduction of 75%. The conversion of the pumping stations from steam to electricity are part of the “Building a New Chicago” program. The Springfield Pumping Station was fully converted from steam to electricity in 2017. The energy efficient station has reduced its carbon footprint and will save an estimated $4M annually with improved reliability and efficiency. The Central Park Pumping Station began construction in Dec 2018 for a similar conversion. The department estimates an annual savings of $4.5M in energy and maintenance expenses.

MWRD has also implemented a sewer thermal heat and cooling system to save energy at its water reclamation plant, where methane is also collected for electricity generation. Moreover, the MWRD operates several anaerobic digesters, generating up to one-third of its energy from the digestion process. A new project will divert 440 tons a day of food waste from the city of Chicago’s solid waste stream, feed it into the digesters at the Calumet treatment plant in Chicago, generate 160% more methane gas, and sell some of this gas back into the natural gas pipeline.

Some of the incentive plans include the use of green energy and equipment modifications. Sweetwater Authority has and continues to partner with our local energy partner to promote water and energy efficiency measures. These events include community fairs, community tailgates, and lighting exchange events. Sweetwater Authority provides device-based rebates to consumers for water and energy and ensures these devices meet or exceed current Watersense and EPA benchmarks for efficiency. This measure is a network of multiple agencies that include Sweetwater Authority, San Diego County Water Authority, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, & San Diego Gas & Electric. Currently, water conservation is voluntary. Two bills, SB 606 and AB 1668, that establish permanent water use restrictions throughout the state were signed into law in 2018. Otay Water District and other water providers will work with the State Water Resources Control Board over the next several years to define how the new laws will be implemented. Efficient use of water is a long-term strategy for Sweetwater Authority as implied in its mission statement. This strategy includes a general emphasis on efficient use and conservation of water, as well as specific targets and conservation measures.

In 2016, the City of Chula Vista created a Water Stewardship Plan with stakeholder input that was approved by City Council in the fall of 2016. This originally started as a water reuse framework and came out of climate action planning efforts. Stakeholders included Sweetwater Authority and Otay Water District. In addition, the 2017 Climate Action Plan includes actions making city water use more visible, and water meter data is now being posted in all City facilities on a monthly basis, alongside energy use data.

","Low-Income Programs

MidAmerican Energy’s residential low-Income program provides financial incentives and education to encourage energy efficiency in existing low-income housing. The program is delivered through three separate components to meet the needs of different customer segments, including statewide weatherization, supplemental weatherization, and home energy reports. The first component, weatherization, encourages comprehensive energy efficiency improvements in existing low-income housing by providing free energy assessments and free on-site installation of heating, water heating, lighting, refrigeration, and insulation measures. The Iowa Department of Human Rights (IDHR), which manages a network of community action program (CAP) agencies, delivers the program by identifying qualifying households and delivering assessments and weatherization services. The Low-Income program supplements funding provided by the Department of Energy’s Weatherization Assistance Program through a long-term contract with IDHR. The program also includes an education component for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP)-eligible customers and a multifamily and institutional housing component. The second component, Energy Wise, is an education component of the program. Additionally, MidAmerican collects customer contributions through ICARE, a bill assistance program that provides 50% of all contributions greater than $250,000 towards low-income supplemental weatherization. 

Participating CAP agencies recruit Energy Wise Program workshop participants through day-to-day interactions with their LIHEAP clients. Each household that attends the training receives a take-home Energy Wise home savings kit. The third component is a Home Energy Report program for a select number of eligible customers. The reports are tailored to include low cost and no cost energy efficiency tips. The fourth component, multifamily, includes institutional housing and emergency shelters. The multifamily component is a joint utility program and is administered by The Energy Group, which provides assessment services and reports directly to the three investor-owned utilities.

In 2021, MidAmerica’s low-income programs achieved 477.60 MWh and 36,881 therms in savings, while spending $526,447 and $1,119,860 on electric and natural gas customers respectively. In 2021, the program served 39,927 electric and 3,476 natural gas low-income customers.

Multifamily Programs

MidAmerican Energy offers the Multifamily Housing program to promote efficiency strategies for existing multifamily properties and provides comprehensive on-site energy assessments, free low-cost efficiency measures, and a comprehensive assessment report that includes recommendations for both individual housing units and common areas. Any prescriptive or cost-effective custom energy efficiency measure is potentially eligible for rebate under the Multifamily Housing program. The Multifamily Housing program provides a comprehensive set of services and financial incentives to serve the varied needs of multifamily property owners, property managers, landlords, and renters in existing buildings. MidAmerican also offers an Income-Qualified Multifamily Housing Program.

The program includes direct install measures such as water-saving measures and LED lighting. The program also includes equipment and insulation measures, such as gas furnaces and boilers, water heaters, heat pumps, air conditioners, programmable thermostats, and insulation. Additionally, low-income multi-family properties, including institutional housing and emergency shelters, received enhanced rebates, up to 40 percent of installed cost, and free professional consultation throughout contractor bidding and equipment insulation.

In 2019, MidAmerica’s multifamily program achieved 536,521 kWh and 28,501 therms in savings, while spending $543,866 and $231,973 on electric and natural gas customers respectively. In 2021, the program served 147 electric multifamily properties and 130 natural gas multifamily properties.

To learn more about the state requirements for electric and gas efficiency, please visit the Connecticut page of the State Database.

The Metropolitan District (MDC) for the City of Hartford is the municipal utility that provides the city with drinking water services, wastewater treatment, and stormwater management.

Last Updated: August 2023
","In 2021, Eversource reported 213,607 MWh in net electric incremental savings.

In 2021, Connecticut Natural Gas reported savings of 1.63 MMtherms from natural gas efficiency programs.

Eversource offers electric efficiency incentives and technical assistance to residential and commercial customers. Connecticut Natural Gas similarly offers natural gas efficiency programs to residential and business customers.

City staff meet regularly with the utilities through the Energy Opportunities program, which involves tracking projects and monthly meetings with energy project stakeholders. The City of Hartford also has a series of letters of agreement with Eversource, reflecting anticipated incentives that will offset project costs related to energy efficiency measures. In addition, the City’s Energy Improvement District Board and the Climate Stewardship Council also have representatives from Eversource. Most recently, the City jointly partners with several utilities on the Energy Equity Challenge, which encourages local property owners and renters to measure and reduce energy. Additional resources, such as solar for low-income households, are also offered.

","Low-Income Programs

Both Eversource and Connecticut Natural Gas provide the Home Energy Solutions—Income-Eligible Program to qualified low-income residential customers in both single and multifamily buildings. Eversource also runs New Construction, Retail Products, and Residential Financing programs for income-eligible customers. The Home Energy Solutions program provides no-cost weatherization measures and low-cost energy efficiency upgrades. Weatherization measures include air sealing, duct sealing, lighting fixtures, water efficiency measures, and insulation. Energy-efficient upgrades include appliance replacements, water heaters, HVAC systems, and windows. The program also includes funds to address health and safety issues. The utilities streamline eligibility with the federal Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) requirements, as well as the CT Green Bank application. The program is supported by Energize Connecticut and utilities partner with community action agencies to cost share for WAP-funded projects.

Additionally, the utilities have implemented its retail lighting programs directly targeted at the low-income segment of the market. They have done this through outreach to local retailers who serve the hard-to-reach (“HTR”) customer market segment. HTR markets are defined as customers not typically reached through conventional retail and marketing channels, and are typically described in demographic terms (i.e., income-eligible, ethnic, urban, or rural). The utilities’ efforts regarding this market segment began in 2017 with a focused effort of offering LED incentives, marketing, and educational focus to HTR retail outlets and local retailers. Eversource and Connecticut Natural Gas partner with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection to administer and provide cost-sharing opportunities with the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). The utility has limited funding for health and safety barrier remediation and can leverage funding from other sources.

In 2021, according to Eversource, it achieved 6,496 MWh in energy savings while spending $19,925,765 on its low-income programs and served 14,363 low-income customers. In 2021, according to Connecticut Natural Gas, it achieved 0.27 MMtherms in energy savings, while spending $3,696,772 on its low-income programs and served 4,300 low-income customers.

In late 2019 and early 2020, the City of Hartford organized an Energy Equity Challenge, and worked in partnership with a variety of organizations, including Community Renewal Team to promote this voluntary challenge for local residents and property owners. By convening a group of stakeholders dedicated to expanding access to renewable energy and efficiency programs, the City is providing in-kind support that allows for better outcomes across a series of programs related to weatherization, fuel delivery, and utility bill assistance. The City of Hartford also has a Housing Preservation Loan Fund Program, which is administered by the Department of Development Services. The fund offers financing for deep retrofit projects to owners of 1-to-4-unit properties. The City also partners with Eversource to secure the implementation of their Home Energy Solutions Program that leverages selected energy contractors to implement energy efficiency programs to low-income residents in Hartford.

Multifamily Programs

Both Eversource and Connecticut Natural Gas participate in Energize Connecticut’s Multifamily Initiative. The Multifamily Initiative accomplishes comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades by assessing the property holistically throughout the building’s dwelling units, common areas, and exterior spaces. A combination of residential and commercial energy savings measures is evaluated, and custom incentives are offered through an incentive commitment letter provided to the property owner. Tenant-occupied areas (e.g., apartments and condominium living spaces) can receive direct install dwelling unit measures as part of these Multifamily Initiative services. These measures include building envelope air sealing, domestic hot water (“DHW”) savings measures, sealing of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (“HVAC”) ductwork, and the installation of energy-efficient lighting. The Multifamily Initiative also provides incentives for many measures beyond the direct-install dwelling unit measures, called add-on measures, which includes insulation, HVAC equipment, DHW heating equipment, HVAC and DHW controls, appliances, windows, connected Wi-Fi Thermostats, lighting fixtures and lighting controls in dwelling units, exteriors and common areas and other custom measures.

The Multifamily Initiative is tailored to the multifamily segment and combines aspects of the Companies’ residential energy efficiency programs, such as Home Energy Solutions (“HES”) and HES-Income Eligible, with the Companies’ commercial and industrial (“C&I”) programs, including the Energy Opportunities, Energy Conscious Blueprint, and Small Business Energy Advantage (“SBEA”) programs. This approach offers flexibility to multifamily property owners and their tenants to save energy and money under a seamless umbrella initiative.In 2021, according to Eversouce, it achieved 4,697 MWh in energy savings from its multifamily program while spending $5,039,953. It served 15,301 housing units in 238 multifamily properties. In 2021, according to Connecticut Natural Gas, it achieved 0.3MMtherms in energy savings from its multifamily program while spending $2,138,162.

","Utility Climate Mitigation Goal

In 2019, Eversource Energy set a company-wide goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. To achieve this goal, Eversource Energy will need to reduce emissions by 9.09% annually from 2019 levels.

City-Led Efforts to Decarbonize the Electric Grid

The Mayor’s Office of Sustainability had previously testified before the state legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee in favor of SB 336, which advocated for the adoption of a shared and community solar program to likely be administered by the utilities. The city also advocated for the preservation of net metering during the same testimony.

The City of Hartford’s Office of Sustainability also staffs the Energy Improvement District Board, which supports the addition of renewable energy capacity throughout Hartford. The City of Hartford's Energy Improvement District is in a unique position to distribute electricity. As a result, the EID Board issued an RFP and selected a contract to establish a shared clean energy facility. In addition, the City’s Energy Improvement District Board issued a Comprehensive Plan, which identified neighborhoods and facilities for potential solar installations. This report focused on community solar as a tool for expanding renewable energy access to our residents, who are primarily low-income.


Clean Distributed Energy Resources 



Article XIV of the Hartford Municipal Code created the Energy Improvement District (EID). The purpose of the EID and its board is to enter contracts for the creation of several distributed energy resources. 



Hartford's EID recently released a request for proposal for the installation of a community solar system. The EID identified battery storage as a resource that may be included in proposals. 



Municipal Renewable Energy Procurement 



Hartford has installed 2.2 MW of solar capacity on municipal facilities. 



City Renewable Energy Incentive and Financing Programs 



Sections 4.3.2.B.(13).C and 4.3.2.B.(13).B grant density bonuses to developments that respectively install a renewable energy system providing at least 25% of energy demand and a combined heat and power system cover 50% of the building’s heating and cooling needs.  



The city also offers commercial property owners access to property assessed clean energy finance for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. 



The City of Hartford's Energy Equity Challenge included promoting the CT Green Bank's Solar for All initiative, which is a program that increases access to solar for low-income homes through incentives, loans, and other measures.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Although the local water and energy utilities do not offer joint efficiency programs in Hartford, Eversource and Connecticut Natural Gas’s Home Energy Solutions and Home Energy Solutions-Income Eligible programs will replace inefficient faucet aerators and showerheads. Energize CT is a portal for incentives and programs related to both energy and water efficiency measures. On Energize CT, there is an option to search for natural gas-powered water heaters and hot water-related rebates and incentives. In addition, the City of Hartford and MDC, the water utility, have collaborated to directly provide water conservation materials. In 2018, the City began its Retain the Rain program, and during the fall phase, MDC provided 200 upcycled rain barrels to support the initiative. In 2019, the City received a national grant to fund the next phase of Retain the Rain, a stormwater management program with free green materials for Hartford residents. As a part of the 2019 Retain the Rain program, the City has 700 rain barrels, 200 trees, and 80 composters available for the community, and trees. 200 rain barrels have been distributed thus far. The water utility has assisted in outreach efforts for this program. Although stormwater is a focus of the program, the main purpose of rain barrels is water conservation, capturing and storing water for later use. This program concluded in 2021.

Hartford Metropolitan District (MDC)’s strategic plan includes water conservation as a priority, with several strategies in place to reduce water consumption.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

The MDC has not yet established an energy efficiency goal for water operations, but there have been a series of measures undertaken to improve the efficiency of its wastewater treatment facility. Through subsidies from an Energize CT program, the utility was able to complete energy efficiency upgrades as part of its “Bio Nutrient Removal” Phase II Project. A total cost savings for the project is anticipated to be $8.2 million from avoided consumption of 55 million kWh over the lifetime of the equipment.

There is a waste heat recapture system at the wastewater treatment facility. The MDC facility converts biosolids to energy which generates up to 40% of the facility’s energy.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Although the energy and water utilities do not offer joint energy and water efficiency programs, the utility program does have a partnership with Hawai’i County’s Board of Water Supply that includes providing funding for water leak detectors. Additionally, Hawai’i Energy manages the State’s Public Benefits Fund, and the Board of Water Supply (BWS) is in the process of executing an Energy Saving Performance Contract project.

The City and County of Honolulu Board of Water Supply has water conservation goals detailed in their 2016 Water Master Plan. This document includes a comprehensive program that looks ahead 30 years to evaluate the entire water system, quantify future demands and source options, identify necessary improvements, and balance needs and costs of providing water to residents and visitors. The City’s Board of Water Supply also has a goal of achieving an average of less than 145 GPCD (gallons per capita per day) by 2040. This goal was formed via a 2016 baseline of 155 GPCD based on current island-based regional trends and projection for future conservation.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

The City’s Board of Water Supply is currently implementing a $33 million “efficiency plus” contract to reduce the City’s Board of Water Supply energy use by 12% or 8 million kWh and ~6k MT CO2e annually. These projects target the water authority and wastewater treatment improvements financed by $143 million in taxable green bonds.

The city has a pilot wastewater plant that generates approximately 800,000 therms of energy annually, enough to power 0.86% of O‘ahu households. In December 2018, Hawai‘i Gas became the first in the state to capture and process biogas from the City and County of Honolulu’s Honouliuli Wastewater Treatment Plant on O‘ahu. Hawai‘i Gas was awarded the contract for capturing and processing biogas at Honouliuli from the City and County of Honolulu in August 2016 after a competitive bidding process.

Climate Mitigation Goal

The City of Houston has a goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 through its Climate Action Plan, which also applies to municipal operations.  The Houston Climate Action Plan sets interim greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals for 2030  (40% reduction) and 2040 (75% reduction) from the 2014 baseline, with the final goal of a 100% reduction by 2050. ACEEE was unable to project if the city will achieve its near-term local government GHG emissions reduction goal because insufficient GHG emissions data were available for our analysis.

Energy Reduction Goal

Through the Better Buildings Challenge, the city established a goal to achieve 20% energy reduction below 2008 levels by 2021. Municipal buildings account for 7 million out of 30 million square feet of the city’s commitment. Additionally, per state law (Texas Health and Safety Code §388.005), the City of Houston is required to establish a goal to reduce electric consumption by at least five percent each state fiscal year. The City of Houston actively strives to meet this 5% target each year.

Renewable Energy Goal

The City's Climate Action Plan includes a goal to use 100% renewable energy for municipal operations by 2025. As of July 1, 2020, Houston began purchasing 100% renewable energy through a contract with the City's retail electric provider.

Last updated: June 2021
","Fleet Policies and Composition

Houston uses the following policy in determining the fuel/propulsion type for each vehicle/unit of equipment purchased:  if a battery electric unit is available and is practical/feasible fit for the intended application, purchase the battery electric unit; if not, if a hybrid electric unit is available and is practical/feasible fit for the intended application, purchase the hybrid electric unit; if not, purchase conventional. This policy has been approved by the Mayor. In accordance with City policy, each City vehicle/unit of equipment purchase must be first approved by the City's Fleet Management Department before the requisition can be processed for procurement.  The Fleet Management Department is responsible for ensuring the requested vehicle/unit of equipment has been appropriately selected/sized for the given application and, to ensure that the selection is aligned with the City's Climate Action Plan. The City has a policy that limits vehicle engine idle time to more than 5 minutes in order to minimize GHG emissions. Houston Airport System looks for EV and alternative fuels and if available and economical we will purchase them. Houston’s municipal fleet is currently composed of 6.1% efficient vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles. 

Public Lighting

Houston has not adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association’s Model Lighting Ordinance, however the city’s streetlights have photo sensors, so they only operate when needed. As of December 2022, Houston and CenterPoint Energy have converted 177,617 streetlights to LEDs, accounting for approximately 99% of the city’s streetlights.  

Inclusive procurement 

Houston has an MWDBE (minority, women-owned and disadvantaged business enterprises) program to stimulate the growth of MWDBE by encouraging their full participation in procurement activities and by affording fair opportunity to compete in City contracts.  The policy has been applied to the City's electric supply agreement, through which Houston purchases 100% renewable energy. This Houston disparity study includes when and how recommendations will be implemented. Houston screens contractors to ensure they do not have a history of violating workplace laws or other regulatory protections.

","Building Benchmarking

Houston committed to benchmarking approximately 21% (of total square feet) to the Better Buildings Challenge. Energy use is monitored annually through Energy Star Portfolio.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategy

In the City’s municipal energy efficiency program, 6 million square feet of municipal buildings are achieving guaranteed energy use reductions approaching 30% with average paybacks of less than 10 years. The City makes energy efficiency upgrades through the use of CIP projects. The City is also participating in a sub-metering program that allows key users to monitor electricity usage in real-time and more effectively respond to inefficiencies. Additional initiatives include the City of Houston General Services Department (GSD) Energy Efficiency Project. GSD applied to the State Energy Conservation Office (SECO) for energy efficiency funding under its LoanSTAR (Saving Taxes and Resources) Revolving Loan Program to fund the energy cost reduction measures identified by Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) Energy Systems Laboratory. TEES conducted and developed a Preliminary Energy Assessment (PEA). The total estimated cost of the loan, including energy cost reduction measures and project management is $2,326,526 with a payback of 8.7 years. GSD will implement the energy cost reduction measures at several City facilities.

Municipal Employee Transportation Benefits 

Houston’s Employee & Transit Program provides either a parking permit or a transit pass to employees working in the downtown and surrounding area. They do not have data on estimating emissions for employees opting for transit passes. The program also began offering a vanpool program in 2020 which started with 11 employees participating. In 2022, 41 employees participate in the vanpool program and our transit partner, Metro, estimates the vanpool program for city employees has resulted in 221,396 reduced VMTs (Vehicle Miles Traveled) in 2022.

Still, KUB strives for efficiency in its water and wastewater operations, and recent efforts include installing LED lighting, participating in TVA’s demand response program, improving aeration systems, and implementing advanced technology to prevent water loss.

In addition to water and energy conservation, KUB is a Platinum-level participant in the National Biosolids Partnership, through which all of the organic solids (approx. 33,000 wet tons per year) from the wastewater treatment process are certified as fertilizer by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and applied to regional farmlands at no cost to the farmers. An interdisciplinary team within KUB remains active in exploring additional efficiency opportunities. Implementation of data analytics software is scheduled to support efficiency efforts.

KUB’s Kuwahee (KUW) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) produces approximately 359 MMBTU of biogas per day. Biogas is captured for direct use of two processes at the plant including mixing and heating sludge. Biogas used for the heating process is redirected away from the environment and provides an alternative to natural gas.

Two design parameters were key in the establishment of the Hometown Help Low Income Energy Efficiency Program:

No Cost- participating customers are not required to pay for products and services included in the program.

Convenient- program is designed to minimize the requirements for participation and make it easy for qualified customers to get help.

The City of Lansing has a 47% rental population, tenants and landlords are also offered the Hometown Help energy assessment through the BWL Multi-Family program. This energy assessment is at no cost, and ENERGY STAR refrigerator replacement is also offered at no cost (a previous requirement for a 25% co-pay was waived during the pandemic, including 2021). There was specific outreach conducted for this program in 2021, which was made to registered landlords by the City of Lansing’s housing ombudsman. This has resulted in more low-income occupied residences getting efficient refrigerators that lower electric bills.

The Consumers Energy’s Income-Qualified Energy Efficiency Assistance Program consists of various residential initiatives serving households that meet the income criteria of being at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) or 80% of AMI.  This program aids single-family, income-eligible Consumers Energy customers to reduce energy consumption and improve comfort in their home. It offers no-cost direct services that include energy efficiency upgrades, home energy assessments and energy-saving education.

The Consumers Energy Multifamily Energy Efficiency Program consists of various offerings for customers that meet the eligibility requirements for the program. Multifamily is defined as properties containing 3+ units under a single roof.  Income qualified is defined as 66% of tenants living at or under 200% of the federal poverty level or 80% of AMI.  This program offers direct install of free products including: LED bulbs, pipe wrap, showerheads and faucet aerators.  The program also provides access to prescriptive measures for HVAC, lighting, water heating and building envelope.  Any projects that do not qualify under the prescriptive measures can also apply for a custom project were the savings are calculated based on actual energy savings. Customers are also eligible to receive an assessment which identifies recommendations and measures that customers may take advantage of energy efficiency upgrades in their properties.

In addition, the City’s residential meters are at the end of their useful life and are due for replacement. As a result, new meters will be installed over the next five years. Both of these efforts lead to either identifying or reducing non-revenue water.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Minneapolis’s Water Works (a city water park) is included in the 1.5% annual goal to reduce energy use in city facilities. Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (Metro) came very close to meeting its 2015 energy goal of reducing energy purchases by 25% from 2006 levels. After reaching 23% reductions, a new goal was set to further reduce energy purchases by 10% between 2015 and 2020. Specific strategies to meet the goals include optimizing aeration processes, installing the Blue Lake wastewater treatment plant digester, installing the non-condensing steam turbine at the Metro wastewater treatment plant, and replacing the return- and waste-activated sludge pump drives at Metro.

The Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant currently uses incinerators to burn the biosolids removed from the treated water to create energy for the operations of the plant. At the Blue Lake wastewater treatment plant, methane biogas recovered from the digester facility replaces 9 million BTU/hour of natural gas that powers the solids facility.

Water plant efficiency and self-generation

The City of Nashville has established an energy management strategy aimed at increasing energy efficiency throughout the city’s water service operation system. This strategy is focused at analyzing and optimizing energy usage in treatment plants and in watershed management operations. Metro Water Service has upcoming energy reduction projects designed and ready for construction. These projects include solar panel installation at three of the plants, switching to fine bubble aeration at the Whites Creek wastewater treatment plant, designing and pursuing LEED certification on all new buildings, and utilizing digester gas from the Dry Creek wastewater treatment plant in a CHP system.

Nashville’s wastewater treatment plant uses biogas captured from the treatment process to generate electricity onsite. Metro Water Services utilizes approximately 75% of its digester gas onsite to assist in biosolids production at the large Central Wastewater Treatment Plant. The digester gas is used to power the dryers and boilers instead of purchasing natural gas. By refining the use of the digester gas, Metro Water Services saves nearly $1,000,000 by not purchasing natural gas.

Entergy New Orleans offers a Low-Income Audit & Weatherization program which gives qualified customers the opportunity to receive energy efficiency measures in their homes free of charge. Projects range from direct install measures, such as LED light bulbs and water savings measures, to smart thermostats and comprehensive envelope measures (attic insulation, air sealing, and duct sealing).

The New Orleans Energy Smart program partnered with Total Community Action that uses LIHEAP funding in the Total Power Program. In the program, customers in arrears are given energy efficiency education, a home energy assessment, and energy efficiency measures if needed.  Participants also have their arrearage reduced gradually if they meet program goals.

Local government, nonprofit, and community organizations provide input into program design and delivery through various technical conferences and through the Stakeholder Advisory Committee, which consists of numerous government and community groups and meets annually.

In 2021, according to Entergy New Orleans, it achieved 3,053 Mwh in electric energy savings from its low-income programs, while serving 1,226 electric low-income customers, and spending $2,033,465.

Multifamily Programs

Entergy New Orleans offers the Multi-Family program, which targets multi-family property owners and managers, as well as apartment and condo renters. The program addresses their unique needs, which are often overlooked, through a combination of incentives for both direct install and prescriptive measures, and thorough property owner and tenant education. The program was expanded to include duplex homes, which provided more opportunities for energy savings within this program. The program inspection includes a visual inspection of the common and living spaces, attics, crawl space/basement, and exterior of the building, as well as a discussion of lifestyle and customer behaviors that impact energy use. Following the assessment, the program recommends home improvements to increase energy efficiency. The Multifamily program provides incentives for installing ceiling insulation, duct sealing, and air infiltration sealing in the form of a discount to the customer.

In 2019, according to Entergy New Orleans, it saved 1,167,364 MWh from its multifamily program while spending $498,513 and serving 612 multifamily housing units.

","Fleet Policies and Composition

New York City has legislated fuel efficiency for public fleet vehicles, Local Law 38 of 2005 requires that the most fuel efficient vehicles in class for light and medium duty units be purchased; Local Law 76 of 2013 requires the City to achieve specific benchmarks in improving the fuel economy of City owned vehicles;  Local Law 73 of 2013 requires that biodiesel be used in City fleet trucks and also that the City retrofit or replace fleet trucks without diesel particulate filters; and Local Law 75 of 2013 requires the City to report on actual fuel economy for City vehicles, as opposed to the manufacturer’s list fuel economy.   Additionally, as part of the NYC Clean Fleet initiative to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2025, this city is planned to operate the largest EV fleet in the country at 2,000+ vehicles. The city has already purchased over 500 EV municipal vehicles. Furthermore, this city implemented a Clean Fleet Transition Policy (CFTP) as part of its published Fleet Management Manual and rules.  The CFTP requires that all vehicle replacements be as or more fuel efficient than the vehicle they will replace and that the Chief Fleet Officer approves any requests to replace any vehicle with a less fuel-efficient version. The City now operates over 1,750 on-road electric vehicles, the largest network for any municipal government. Light-duty fleet vehicles purchased during the most recent fiscal year achieved an average fuel economy equivalent of 100 miles per gallon. Additionally, the city met its goal of having 2,000 electric vehicles in its fleet by 2025 in 2019. The goal has now been adjusted to own 4,000 electric vehicles by 2025. New York City’s municipal fleet is currently composed of 24.99% efficient vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles.

Public Lighting

We could not confirm if New York City has adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association’s Model Lighting Ordinance. However, the city publishes a Street Design Manual, which includes a Lighting Catalogue, outlining options for both new and replacement street and pedestrian lighting for New York City. Additionally, the City of New York provides significant funding for lighting upgrades, including occupancy sensors, daylighting and other controls at City buildings.  To date over $63 million has been allocated for lighting-related upgrades at municipal buildings. The Department of Transportation is currently retrofitting all of New York's streetlights with LEDs. New York has upgraded almost all of their streetlights to LEDs.

Inclusive procurement  

New York has established a Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprise program. The city set a goal of having $25 billion go toward M/WBEs by 2025 and raised the M/WBE discretionary spending limits to $500,000. Current energy efficiency and clean energy projects coordinated through the Division of Energy Management have been assigned M/WBE goals. New York's most recent disparity study was released in 2018. New York City participates in PLAs and screens contracts to ensure they meet labor requirements.

","Building Benchmarking 

In December 2009, the city council passed four laws, collectively known as the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, that require energy efficiency upgrades to and energy transparency in large existing buildings. In compliance with Local Law 84 of 2009, benchmarking results are reported for all city buildings that are more than 10,000 gross square feet that are owned by the city or for which the city pays all or part of the annual energy bill. In 2015, there was a total of 3,649 benchmarked facilities (288 million square feet). As a result, 95% of local government building square footage is benchmarked in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager. As the city benchmarks additional properties beyond the requirements of the law, nearly 99% of New York City buildings are benchmarked.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategy

The city conducts energy audits and retro-commissioning studies to measure the energy performance of its portfolio and identify opportunities for retrofits. The city then prioritizes buildings with the greatest opportunity for energy savings through a comprehensive retrofit targeting city buildings with the largest energy demands and most complex energy consuming systems.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

While the City of New York does not run a program with deep water savings measures and energy savings measures, the National Grid has a Commercial Direct Install Program, which offers commercial customers no-cost installation of high-efficiency water and energy savings measures. Consolidated Edison provides energy-efficient and low-flow devices through their energy efficiency programs.

In 2019, NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) released the updated Water Demand Management Plan, a citywide program targeting a 5% overall reduction in water consumption citywide by October 2022. The plan consists of multiple strategies and more than 21 initiatives to achieve a target reduction of approximately 50 million gallons per day.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

DEP completed energy audits at all 14 in-city wastewater treatment plants and has accepted over 130 energy conservation measures (ECMs) that have the potential to reduce energy use by 2.9 MMBTU per year. While there is no set annual “target” for energy efficiency, the Agency is currently working on an integration study to align those ECMs with State of Good Repair (SOGR) plans and projects so that ECMs are completed concurrently with ongoing, necessary maintenance and repair work at the 14 in-city plants. Additionally, DEP had a target to beneficially use 60% its anaerobic digester gas for thermal and/or electric energy by 2017. DEP currently produces over 3.5 billion cubic feet of anaerobic digester gas (ADG) per year, approximately 60% of which is made of methane. DEP beneficially uses approximately 40% of the produced anaerobic digester gas (ADG). These efforts support the reduction target set by PlaNYC, where city government buildings are to reduce their GHG emissions by 30% by 2017 from a 2005 baseline. Internally, DEP has implemented a Standard Operating Procedure to govern energy conservation and GHG reduction design considerations during the project design lifecycle, from the selection of the designer to commissioning of the installed equipment. Energy design guidelines for unit processes or equipment accompany the SOP and provide guidance on how to increase energy efficiency with any new facility construction or reconstruction projects.

At the Owl’s Head WWTP, there are three 1.6 MW dual fuel engines to generate electricity at the plant which offset approximately 40% of the plant’s electric needs. Moreover, The Coney Island WWTP has four 1.6 MW engine generators. These cogeneration units have been in service for over 30 years. The plant is generating over 80% of total electric power from these engines and utilizes nearly 100% digester gas production at plant. DEP also designed a 16 MW cogeneration system at the North River WWTP which operates at an average of 10 MW and uses ADG and utility natural gas. The system  meets the plant’s base electrical demand and all thermal heating needs.

The City of Philadelphia adopted a Municipal Energy Master Plan for the Built Environment focused on strategies for reduced emissions and energy use; and increased renewable energy.  Through the MEMP, the City will work to implement energy efficiency in its municipal buildings through a variety of difference retrofit techniques outlined in the plan with a goal of reducing energy consumption from both electricity and thermal (natural gas and steam) at least 20% by 2030.  Large facilities will meet this goal through comprehensive retrofits that are performed through energy performance contracts, while smaller facilities will receive more targeted improvements including LED lighting and building controls upgrades. The Office of Budget Management provides the Energy Office with a baseline of $250,000 a year to support energy efficiency investments in municipal buildings. While more can be and is often allocated, this amount represents the average about of revenue the Energy Office generates in utility rebates and demand response programs.

","Low-Income Programs

PECO offers the Low-Income Energy Efficiency (LEEP) Program to qualified low-income residential customers. This program provides in-home audits, education, and direct installation of energy efficiency measures, and measure giveaways in order to reduce energy consumption in low-income households. Improvements include weatherization, installation of CFL bulbs, health and safety measures, water efficiency measures, and the replacement of inefficient refrigerators. The program also includes enhanced incentives for low-income customers through the Lighting Solution, a retail pathway to reduce financial barriers to purchasing the most efficient technology when they are shopping for new products. These upstream retail incentives will be targeted specifically to stores and zip codes with primarily low-income customers and will include higher incentives than the non-low-income targeted retail measures.

Other PECO low-income programs include the Customer Assistance Program – Percentage of Income Payment Plan (CAP-PIPP), Matching Energy Assistance Fund (MEAF), Low Income Usage Reduction Program (LIURP), and Customer Assistance and Referral Evaluation Services (CARES). As of 2023, PECO was also implementing a health and safety pilot program to assess whether addressing health and safety barriers in income-eligible homes would allow PECO to provide increased efficiency measures to income-eligible customers while advancing its overall energy savings goals. The pilot term will be 12 to 18 months. More information can be found on PECO’s website.

In 2021, according to PECO, it achieved 5,034 MWh in energy savings, while spending $2,192,000 on its low-income programs and served 34,849 low-income customers.

PGW offers the Home Comfort Program to qualified low-income residential customers. This program includes measures such as air sealing, insulation, duct sealing, programmable thermostats, heater replacements and repairs, high-efficiency water heaters, water heater pipe wrap, and water efficiency measures. Incidental health and safety repairs can also be performed as part of a comprehensive job. The program targets the highest energy users in PGW’s Customer Responsibility Program. PGW also offers a pilot Low Income Multifamily Efficiency (LIME) program. This pilot program offers direct install measures to qualifying multifamily building. PGW coordinates weatherization measures with the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative (GGHI), and Lead Poison Prevention programs. PGW also coordinates with Habitat for Humanity Philadelphia and streamlines delivery with contractors.

In 2021, PGW’s low-income energy efficiency programs achieved 52,724 MMtherms in energy savings while spending $9,109,734 and serving 1,904 households. The City of Philadelphia contributes funds to local providers, specifically the Energy Coordinating Agency (ECA), who implement the federal Weatherization Assistance Program and/or utility-led low-income efficiency programs. ECA’s “Conservation Services” department handles federally funded WAP programming. The City’s Division of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) funds ECA to supervise a network of Neighborhood Energy Centers (NECs), each of which acts as a one-stop-shop for application assistance with programming and gives workshops on energy conservation funded byPGW. Further, DHCD funds ECA for general subcontracting for the City’s Basic Systems Repair Program, a city-funded program that provides free repairs to basic home systems, such as electrical systems and plumbing, for eligible owner-occupied homes in Philadelphia.

Multifamily Programs

All low-income programs are open to multifamily units. The multifamily component provides analysis, direct install measures, and larger, investment-level upgrades to improve the energy efficiency of multifamily buildings, both in units and in common areas. The component serves buildings with market-rate customers, income eligible customers, and a mix of residential and commercial customer types. Program participants receive an assessment of their building’s energy performance and direct installation of basic efficiency measures (e.g., LED lighting, water conservation devices, hot water pipe insulation, smart strips). A subset of participants may opt in for additional rebates of more comprehensive measures (such as insulation and air sealing).

In 2021, according to PECO, it achieved 6,147 MWh savings from its multifamily programs while serving 11,401 housing units. Total spending was not available for 2021.

PGW also offers the Low-Income Multifamily Efficiency (LIME) program and the Custom retrofit program for multifamily properties.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Currently, the energy and water utilities do not offer joint efficiency programs to residential or commercial customers. The City of Phoenix is a major contributor to the Water Use It Wisely campaign, an educational campaign aimed at increasing water efficiency across Phoenix. As a result, water use per capita has dropped 34% since 1996 and 6% in the last two years. The city also retrofits 200-250 income-qualified homes with high-efficiency fixtures and toilets. Phoenix partners with Salt River Project on a water conservation program that encourages residents to reduce water and energy use in landscaping.

Currently, the energy and water utilities do not offer joint efficiency programs to residential or commercial customers. The City has set nonrevenue water-saving goals at their water department, which are aimed at keeping annual water losses below 10%. The wastewater utility has undertaken significant energy upgrade projects such as variable speed pumps funded through water revenues. The business plan has set goals related to energy efficiency.

 

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

The Water Services Department (WSD) partners with local electric service providers to implement energy conservation measures at its facilities. To date, energy conservation measures from these programs have saved 5.8 million kWh annually. The WSD has joined the Department of Energy’s Better Plans Program, setting a goal to reduce energy intensity (kWh/million gallons) by 25% over a 10-year period, baseline year 2015. It is also participating in the DOE’s Wastewater Infrastructure Accelerator through the Better Buildings Program. The city-owned water utility also falls under the city-wide goal to reduce energy use by 20% by 2020 from 2009 levels despite a growing population and water services. The department goal is to operate at the highest level of efficiency and cost effectiveness and has upgraded many of the facilities and pumping stations.

Digester gas is used at the 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Facility, in boilers to maintain digester temperatures, offsetting its thermal load by 68,000 MMBtu per year. Additionally, a large Energy Services Company (ESCO) is under contract to build and operate a facility recovery and clean-up digester gas that is currently being flared. In 2018, the City invested in a $25M gas capture and treatment plant that receives wastewater from 5 nearby cities that converts methane captured from wastewater to green gas and inserts it into the natural gas pipeline—generating $6M annually in gross revenue through a partnership with Ameresco. The facility will provide an annual energy offset of approximately 693,500 dekatherms annual renewable natural gas, reducing carbon emissions by nearly 45,000 tons/year, which is the equivalent of taking over 70,000 cars off the road or planting over 87,000 acres of trees every year. In addition to treating 100% of the wastewater for the region, and capturing all the waste methane and converting it to green gas, the City also extracts the sludge and puts it on non-food crop farmland as a fertilizer replacement. Phoenix is the only City in the nation that utilizes all three wastewater streams for beneficial use.

The Low-Income Weatherization program is designed to reduce the energy usage and utility costs of lower income tenants residing in affordable rental housing. The program is partially funded by the PPC and receives 11.7 percent of PPC revenues. That revenue contributes to grants for the construction or rehabilitation of affordable rental housing that is located in PGE’s or Pacific Power’s service territories. Use of these funds requires that at least 50 percent of the units in the project be rented to households whose income is at or below 60 percent of the AMI. Projects receiving funds must also remain affordable for at least 10 years. For each dollar invested, the project must demonstrate at least one kilowatt-hour in energy savings in the first year of operation.

Program resources may be used for shell measures such as windows, doors, and insulation as well as for energy efficient appliances and lighting. The program also provides home weatherization for single- and multi-family, owner occupied, and rental housing). In either case, projects supported by PPC funds for weatherization are required to have a conservation element.

NW Natural offers the Oregon Low-Income Energy Efficiency Program and the Washington Low-Income Energy Efficiency Program to qualified customers. These programs include gas measures such as insulation, windows, doors, pipe insulation, duct insulation, duct sealing, furnaces, infiltration, water heating, and faucet aerators.

In June 2020, the Richmond City Council adopted a resolution to ""recognize the effects of global warming caused by human activity and to establish a climate action goal to achieve a 45% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from the 2008 baseline. ACEEE was unable to project if the city will achieve its near-term GHG emissions reduction goal for municipal operations because insufficient GHG emissions data were available for our analysis.

Energy Reduction Goal

The original RVAgreen plan included a suggested target to reduce municipal energy use by 1% annually from 2008 levels.

Renewable Energy Goal

In his 2021 State of the City address, Mayor Levar Stoney committed to the city government purchasing off-site renewable energy to cover 50% of government operations electricity usage by 2023, and 100% by 2025.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

Riverside Public Utilities serves both electricity and water to its customers, and it administers both water and energy efficiency programs. The city offers rebates for water-efficient appliances, drought tolerant landscaping and free sprinkler nozzles for both residential and commercial customers. The RPU coordinates with regional agencies, both SoCal Gas and the Metropolitan Water District as well, to offer water conservation and energy efficiency measures. SoCal Gas partners with Riverside in the delivery of the Energy Savings Assistance Program that serves income-qualified residents of Riverside. In addition, the RPU partners with Metropolitan Water District and Western Municipal Water Districts offer rebates for high-efficiency clothes washers, premium high-efficiency toilets, weather-based irrigation controllers, turf replacement, rotating sprinkler nozzles, rain barrels and cisterns, soil moisture sensor systems, water flow monitoring devices, soaker hose incentives, and hose bib irrigation controllers.

In 2008, the city approved the Riverside Recycle Water Project, which will use highly treated wastewater rather than high-quality potable water to serve the agricultural and irrigation needs throughout the city.

In Spring 2023, the wastewater division will undergo two major projects to save energy and reduce costs. The first is shutting down the Activated Plant and treating all wastewater in the MBR plant. This will reduce electricity use by shutting of redundant systems and streamline operations. The second project is the reduced Chlorine Contact Time (CCT) project which will reduce energy and chemical use. The CCT project is scheduled for completion in Fall 2023.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

While the City of Riverside has not established a goal for energy efficiency across municipal water service operations, RPU has worked to replace or rehabilitate inefficient pumps and motors during upgrades.

The wastewater division of the Riverside Public Works department self-generates electricity by capturing methane generated from the wastewater treatment plant's anaerobic digesters. Methane is currently begin utilized at the City's wastewater treatment facility to fuel a 1.4 MW fuel cell and two 9.9 MMBtu per hour boilers. Waste heat from the fuel cell is captured in an onsite heat loop which is used to process heat for the anaerobic digesters. The wastewater division is also undergoing a project to upgrade digester gas (biogas) to pipeline quality renewable natural gas (RNG), upgrade the Digestate Management Facility and rehabilitate digester.

","Commercial and multifamily benchmarking

The State of California adopted Assembly Bill (AB) 802 in October of 2015. It requires commercial and multifamily buildings greater than 50,000 square feet and larger to benchmark energy usage annually. California requires commercial buildings to obtain and disclose ENERGY STAR ratings to transactional counter parties and the California Energy Commission at the time of a sale, lease, or financing for the entire building through AB 1130.

Sacramento is in the process of outlining its own requirements, potentially lowering that 50,000 square feet threshold to encompass more buildings. This is still at a preliminary phase. 

Retrofit requirements

The Existing Building Electrification Ordinance requires all existing buildings to be fully-electric by 2045. The main strategy at the moment is time-of-replacement, where natural gas-based appliances will be converted to electric at the time they are being replaced.

Incentives

The city offers residential and commercial property owners access to property assessed clean energy (PACE) financing for energy efficiency and solar installation projects. It also provides height bonuses for green buildings (incentive for building to CALGreen Tier 1 or Tier 2 standards) adopted in Sept. 2013 and for green roofs and rooftop farms adopted in March 2015.

SMUD, the city’s municipal utility, offers a range of rebates for home energy efficiency improvements. The utility also offers new electric vehicle drivers a free level 2 charger for residential properties. It also offers businesses an incentive for installing an electric vehicle charger.

","Low-Income Programs

SMUD’s low-income energy efficiency programs include weatherization, deep home retrofits, solar bundle installations coupled with energy efficiency, and energy efficiency products for apartments and single-family, and tenant mobile homes. SMUD partners with local community agency advocates and government agencies to educate and promote their programs.

In 2021, we were unable to verify low-income energy efficiency spending and savings for SMUD.

PG&E offers the Energy Savings Assistance Program (ESA) to qualified low-income residential customers. The program provides in-home energy education, and direct installation of weatherization and hot water measures, lighting efficiency upgrades, HVAC tune-ups, smart power strips, and refrigerator recycling/replacement at no charge in order to reduce energy consumption in low-income households. The program provides health and safety measures such as the repair and replacement of water heaters and furnaces and minor home repairs. This program is implemented statewide by investor-owned utilities under the direction of the California Public Utilities Commission. It leverages the federal Weatherization Assistance Program, Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and Low-Income Weatherization Program offerings.

The ESA Program’s objective is to assist income-qualified customers to reduce their energy consumption and costs while increasing their health, comfort and safety. PG&E has also administered the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program to qualifying customers since 1989. The CARE program provides a monthly discount on energy bills for qualifying single-family residential households, tenants of sub-metered residential facilities, non-profit group living facilities, agricultural employee housing facilities, and migrant farmworker housing centers throughout PG&E’s service area.

The California Public Utilities Commission (CAPUC) strongly encourages utilities to leverage funds for low-income energy efficiency and weatherization. PG&E’s ESA Program leverages water agency, Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), and Low Income Weatherization Program (LIWP) funding through individually negotiated agreements with the other agencies.

In 2021, PG&E achieved 0.05 MMtherms in natural gas low-income program savings, while spending $80,963,860 on its natural gas low-income programs and serving 6,831 natural gas customers across its service territory.

Multifamily Programs

SMUD offers a custom incentive program designed for multifamily properties with 5 units or more to support switching from gas to electric space heating, water heating, and cooking appliances. Properties with more than 50% of tenant participating in SMUD’s Energy Assistance Program may qualify for additional incentives. Spending, savings, and customer data for SMUD’s multifamily programs were not available for 2019.

PG&E offers the California New Homes Multifamily Program, Multifamily Upgrade Program, and Multifamily Cooling Optimizer Program. California New Homes Multifamily Program provides support and incentives for multifamily new construction projects to encourage builders to exceed California’s Title 24 energy efficiency standards. The Multifamily Upgrade Program promotes and facilitates energy-efficient retrofits of existing multifamily buildings” through technical support and incentives. The Multifamily Cooling Optimizer Program is a direct install program focused on HVAC measures in tenant spaces. PG&E also implements the Energy Savings Assistance Program (ESA) for income-qualified multifamily customers.

For 2021, PG&E began ramp up on new statewide new construction programs: California Energy-Smart Homes New Construction Program and California Energy Design Assistance New Construction program, both of which can serve the multifamily sector. PG&E also offered the Multifamily Energy Savings Program (MESP) which provides property owners EE upgrade services for multifamily buildings of five units or greater throughout PG&E’s service territory. The program provides end-to-end program implementation services, including marketing, outreach, engineering, operations, customer service, data management, and reporting.

In 2021, PG&E achieved energy savings of 7,992 MWh and 0.13 MMtherms, while spending $20,336,729 on its electric and natural gas multifamily programs. PG&E served 29,727 housing units in 3,085 properties with its multifamily programs in 2021.

Last Updated: August 2023
","PG&E's Building Benchmarking Portal provides aggregate whole-building energy usage data in their ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager to building owners. PG&E uses the Green Button data sharing platform for electricity data only. The utility provides automatic data entry into Portfolio Manager if given written consent by the customer. SMUD provides automated benchmarking through ENERGY STAR for multifamily buildings with 20 units or more and for multitenant commercial buildings.

The city of Sacramento provides community wide energy usage information for planning and evaluation purposes through their community-wide inventory which will form the baseline for creating new energy programs for the residential and nonresidential sectors. SMUD provides community-wide energy usage upon request. Generally, this information is provided annually in conjunction with General Planning and/or Climate Action annual reports and more robust data is provided approximately every 5 years as local plans and GHG baselines are updated. PG&E provides non-confidential, aggregated energy usage data to the public through its Energy Data Request Program. Energy data is publicly released on a monthly basis at the ZIP code level, with significant redaction or further aggregation as needed to comply with California energy data privacy regulations.  

The City of Sacramento advocates for more data transparency, and SMUD is already very cooperative. It does not advocate for better access to utility data for ratepayers or the establishment of data-sharing agreements between the city and its utilities.

The EHARP program will install cold climate air source heat pumps in low-income rental properties heated with electric resistance heating. Units will also undergo weatherization. The intent is to reduce costs and emissions while making the units more comfortable. The hope is to expand the program after the pilot stage. Saint Paul is also using $1 million of federal ARPA funds to develop a low-income pre-weatherization program (Healthy Homes) that local non-profit energy-efficiency agencies will administer.

Multifamily Programs

Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy jointly offer the Multi-Family Building Efficiency (MFBE) program and the Multi-Family Energy Savings Program. The MFBE provides a free whole-building energy audit, whole-building energy usage, free installation of screw-in LEDs, energy-saving faucet aerators and showerheads, water heater blanket and LED signs in the resident’s units and common areas of the buildings. If the building has sufficient cost-effective savings opportunities to reach a minimum of 15% energy savings, they can achieve an incentive of at least 25% of the project cost—the incentive increase with higher savings achievement potential. If the building qualifies as low income, the incentives are doubled. Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy also provides a dedicated low-income multifamily program, Multi-Family Energy Savings Program. This program provides a 25% rebate bonus on top of its standard rebates for income-qualified customers.

In 2021, according to Xcel Energy, it achieved 3,706 MWh of savings, while spending $2,292,300 on its electric multifamily programs, . Xcel served 22,579 electric housing units at 586 multifamily properties in 2021. Xcel energy spent $713,337 on its natural gas multifamily programs. In 2021, we were unable to verify natural gas savings and customers for Xcel Energy.

","Utility Climate Mitigation Goal

In December 2018, Xcel Energy set a goal to provide customers with 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050. They also include an interim goal of reducing carbon emissions 80% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. To achieve this goal, Xcel Energy will need to reduce emissions by 6.2% annually from 2019 levels in the state of Minnesota.

City-Led Efforts to Decarbonize the Electric Grid

In December 2019, the City Council passed a resolution opposing the inclusion of a new natural gas plant in Xcel Energy’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), urging Xcel and the Public Utility Commission (PUC) to instead find ways to further accelerate utility-scale renewables and storage. The resolution directed staff to comment on Xcel’s IRP filing at the PUC. In turn, City staff submitted comments to MN PUC on Xcel Energy's Integrated Resource Plan opposing new fossil gas plant and asking for deeper analysis of renewables plus storage. The City is also supporting analysis being done between District Energy St. Paul and Xcel looking at opportunities to decarbonize District Energy Saint Paul's operations.

The City’s Climate Action and Resilience Plan, published in December 2019, also calls for increasing distributed single-family residential solar on rooftops from the current 7.1 MW citywide to 50 MW by 2030 and 70 MW by 2050, as well as commercial and multi-family targets of 100 MW by 2030 and 160 MW by 2050. The City and Xcel partnered on the Partners in Energy Plan, which became the groundwork for the buildings chapter of the city’s Climate Action and Resilience Plan. The City has also signed a letter of interest with Xcel to purchase 5 MW of renewable through the next round of Xcel’s Renewable Connect program. The City has expressed interest in purchasing Renewable Connect green tariff electricity from Xcel and has expressed initial interest in a new green tariff product Xcel will be offering based on a hydro facility in Saint Paul.


Clean Distributed Energy Resources 



District Energy Saint Paul is the largest district energy system in North America, and the city played a significant role in its creation. The system provides heating and cooling to most buildings in the downtown area and integrates biomass-fired cogeneration, thermal storage, and solar thermal technology. The city also supported the creation of the Energy Park district heating and cooling system, serving several million square feet of office and residential space.  



Saint Paul subscribed to a 3.2 MW community solar system and encourages residents and businesses to subscribe to community solar.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

The utilities currently do not offer joint energy and water efficiency measures. However, Xcel Energy does offer several efficiency measures that also save water, including efficient showerheads, faucet aerators, ENERGY STAR clothes washers, and efficient commercial dishwashers.

The city’s Climate Action and Resilience Plan identifies specific water conservation goals (water use reduction goal of 2% per person per year) and provides several strategies to achieve those goals. SPRWS has found that the most common cause of unintended increased usage is a running toilet. In 2019, as many as 4,700 water customers experienced a potentially leak-related spike in their bill. SPRWS has established a program for early detection and assistance with identifying/fixing malfunctioning toilets. The program has a dual goal of conserving water and preventing financial strain since water bills can add up quickly when leaks related to malfunctioning toilets are left unresolved.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) has two solar projects. The first project is a 53.6 KW system with an approximate generation of 56,5000 kWh per year, which was installed above the Engine Room in 2021. The second project is a 1,000 KW system to be installed above the finished water reservoir and completed in the summer of 2023. SPRWS owns both systems. SPRWS installed LED lighting in its facilities and resized the high-service pump, which will save approximately 150,000 to 300,000 kWh per month.

Metropolitan Council Environmental Services (MCES), which operates and maintains regional sewers and wastewater treatment, is also dedicated to minimizing its energy use and emissions. MCES has met 50% of Executive Order 19-27, directing state agencies to reduce its energy consumption by 30% between 2006 and 2027. The energy conservation work that MCES has implemented equates to about $3 million per year in savings. Over the next 10 years, the solids improvement projects at Empire and Seneca wastewater treatment plants that will further decrease energy consumption.

The MCES operates two wastewater treatment facilities, the Metro plant and the Blue Lake plant, both of which self-generate energy. MCES also produced methane gas through anaerobic digestion.

","Utility Climate Mitigation Goal

In 2021, SDG&E announced its intention to produce power with zero carbon emissions by the year 2045. The year corresponds to California's target goal to get 100% of its electricity from carbon zero sources. To achieve this goal, SDG&E will need to reduce emissions by 3.85% annually from 2019 levels.

City-Led Efforts to Decarbonize the Electric Grid

The City of San Diego initiated the establishment of San Diego Community Power (SDCP), a Community Choice Aggregator that will serve the City of San Diego customers, as well as customers in the cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, and La Mesa. As of summer 2021, SDCP will serve both commercial and residential customers. Additionally, the City is currently negotiating the 50-year electric and gas franchise agreement with SDG&E and intends to leverage the negotiation to increase deployment of renewable and distributed energy generation by the utility.

The city of San Diego is engaged in various regulatory proceedings at the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) and advocates on behalf of the City and/or the community to encourage more renewable generation adoption. The City provided comments in response to the CPUC proceeding addressing microgrids and microgrid tariffs, and the City advocated in the Net Energy Metering proceeding for grandfathering of older net metering rates that the City used to calculate its cost-benefit analysis. The City also participated the regulatory process involving exit fees, which are fees charged to customers who buy electricity from government-run community choice programs rather than traditional utilities.

The City of San Diego is also working with SDG&E for renewable energy interconnection. SDG&E has agreed to put excess generation on the grid and receive credit through RES-BCT tariff. To meet the City’s 2015 Climate Action Plan’s goal of 100% renewable by 2035, City has implemented several privatized solar installations interconnected with utility grid where the City buys solar energy at a fixed bundled price which includes the Renewable Energy Certificates.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

The City of San Diego’s Department of Water Utilities offers water use calculators for household and landscape use. There are also rebate programs available for micro irrigation, turf removal, and rain barrels. The City of San Diego is also a member of the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), which has been partnering with SDG&E for more than twenty years on administering water efficiency programs, such as low-flow showerheads, small business water efficiency equipment, leak loss detection, and education and outreach.

The City of San Diego’s Climate Action Plan has several water savings targets and long-term strategies to reach those targets. One target is to reduce daily per capita water consumption by 4 gallons by 2020 and 9 gallons by 2035 below 2010 levels. The core strategy is to implement an Outdoor Landscaping Ordinance that requires use of weather-based irrigation controllers. Supporting strategies to meet these targets are to record the annual volume percentage of recycled water used and planned to be introduced through 2035 and pursue additional financial resources and incentives for implementing energy and water efficiency measures identified by the conservation and ordinances, and to promote the expansion of greywater systems.

The City is also launching Pure Water San Diego, a phased, multi-year program that will provide one-third of San Diego's water supply locally by 2035. The Pure Water Program will use proven water purification technology to clean recycled water to produce safe, high-quality drinking water. The program offers a cost-effective investment for San Diego's water needs and will provide a reliable, sustainable water supply.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

The City of San Diego’s Climate Action Plan encompasses both local water and wastewater utilities’ operations and include targets to reduce energy consumption at municipal facilities by 15% by 2020 and an additional 25% by 2035 below 2010 levels. Strategies to reach these targets include implementing a Smart Energy Management & Monitoring System for facilities to monitor and track energy consumption and using those results to identify opportunities for great efficiency and demand response along with pursuing LEED for Existing Buildings: Operation and Maintenance Certification for municipal facilities.

Since 2000, the Public Utilities Department has maintained a California Energy Commission-trained Energy Audit Team. Nearly all of the Department's major facilities have energy audit reports. The Department has invested an average of $400,000 per year in energy efficiency projects which have upgraded almost all of its emergency generators, department-owned administration buildings, as well as many of its largest pump stations and wastewater treatment plants. Projects have included lighting re-lamping and control, air conditioning system improvements, and process improvements.

The City of San Diego Public Utilities Department’s Wastewater Branch has multiple self-generating facilities and projects. The City also aims to capture 98% of wastewater treatment gases by 2035. At the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant (PLWWTP), methane gas is captured to fuel two generators for a total capacity of 4.57 MW. The system also produces heat which is used to heat the plant’s digesters. The excess captured digester gas is sold to a private company that cleans the gas to utility standards, injects it into the utility company’s natural gas pipeline, and is used for resale by the privatizer. Methane capture is also utilized at the Metro Biosolids Center (MBC) and at MBC's privatized total cogeneration capacity of 9.6 MW. At the Metro Operation Complex, Department has two solar systems for a total capacity of 0.430MW. The Department’s Water Branch has multiple solar generation facilities. The Alvarado Water Treatment Plant has a 0.95MW privatized solar system. The Otay Water Treatment Plant has a 0.80MW privatized solar system, and the Bayview Reservoir has a City-owned 0.160MW solar system. A 1MW Solar System was recently installed on Clearwell #2 at the Miramar Water Treatment Plant.

The State of California allows its local jurisdictions to adopt building energy codes that are more stringent than the mandatory state codes. Title 24 outlines all California building codes. Title 24, Part 6 includes the California Energy Code and the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES). Title 24, Part 11 includes the California Green Building Code. The 2022 codes exceed the 2021 IECC standards and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-2019. To learn more about California’s building energy codes, please visit the State Policy Database.

Commercial

San Francisco amended the California Green Building Code to create the more stringent San Francisco Green Building Code for commercial buildings.

In 2020, San Francisco adopted an ordinance requiring: (A) All-Electric commercial and multifamily to meet the California Energy Code (e.g. no change from state code), and (B) mixed-fuel commercial and multifamily must be designed and constructed to use 10% less energy than allowed by California Energy Code. See the CEC's list of approved Local Ordinances Exceeding the 2022 Energy Code. The city’s zEPI score for their commercial energy code is 41.

Residential 

San Francisco amended the California Green Building Code to create the more stringent San Francisco Green Building Code for residential buildings.

Similar to RESNET HERS and ICC Energy Rating Index, the California Energy Design Rating compares the proposed building to a circa-2006 reference home. California's Energy Efficiency Standards require a ""Total Energy Design Rating"" inclusive of mandatory solar PV, and an ""Efficiency Energy Design Rating"". In California Energy Commission compliance Climate Zone 3 (San Francisco), Title 24 requires a Total EDR of 24 or less. San Francisco has adopted a local ordinance which allows all-electric new residential to comply with a Total EDR of 24 and a stricter efficiency requirement for mixed-fuel homes (e.g. buildings that install natural gas). Mixed-fuel new residential construction must achieve a Total EDR of 14. See the CEC's list of approved Local Ordinances Exceeding the 2022 Energy Code. The city’s zEPI score for their residential energy code is 26.

Solar-readiness policies

From 2019-2022, California Energy Standards required installation of solar on residential new construction of 3 floors or less (and San Francisco maintained the previously adopted code mandating PV on multifamily of 4-10 floors.) 

From January 2023 onward, the 2022 California Energy Standards require mandatory installation of solar and battery storage on multifamily, and prescriptively require solar PV installation, plus wiring for future installation of batteries, in single family.

EV-charging readiness policies

For new construction and major renovations, San Francisco requires developers install EV-ready infrastructure into 20% of parking spaces, and provide sufficient electrical service to be able to expand charging services to 100% of spaces. For existing commercial parking, San Francisco Environment Code Chapter 30 requires EV charging stations to be installed in a minimum of 10% of spaces in any commercial parking lot with 100 or more spaces by the end of 2023. There are more than 300 facilities in San Francisco subject to this requirement. 

Low-energy use requirements

Since 2008, San Francisco has required residential and commercial new construction to achieve GreenPoint Rated v7.0 and LEED Silver (multifamily high-rises)/LEED Gold respectively. 

In 2020, San Francisco adopted an ordinance requiring all-electric commercial and multifamily buildings to meet the California Energy Code (e.g. no change from state code). Mixed-fuel commercial and multifamily must be designed and constructed to use 10% less energy than allowed by the California Energy Code.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

The City of San Francisco and PG&E do not offer joint water and energy efficiency programs, but the city does have water-saving rebates independent of the energy utility. The City has updated codes requiring water-efficient fixtures/systems such as toilets, irrigation systems, and shower heads. Rebates are offered for high-efficiency washers and low-flow toilets, as well as free water saving kits. The City’s water conservation program was expanded to offer custom rebates based on projected savings as well as fixed rebates for common measures, similar to its energy efficiency programs. Additionally, the City provides a rebate for residences building a graywater recycling system on-site. PG&E also offers rebates for high-efficiency commercial dishwashers.

San Francisco aims to use less than 50 gallons of water per capita per day city-wide. Water use in the city has remained below 50 gallons per capita per day since 2014.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Energy efficiency projects have been completed at 11 water and wastewater facilities, with additional efficiency improvements planned as part of ongoing system renewal work. For example, through the Sewer System Improvement Program, the Southeast Treatment Plant is undergoing operational improvements and upgrades that will include increased energy efficiency and resource recovery.

The SFPUC has installed large electric cogeneration plants that utilize digester gas at two of its wastewater treatment plants, Southeast and Oceanside. Though no energy-savings target has been set, these systems generate 2 MW and 1 MW at peak, respectively. The electricity generated is used on-site. The SFPUC has also installed six different solar photovoltaic projects at its facilities, including a 5 MW solar project at Sunset Reservoir.

The Hetch Hetchy system delivers water to 2.7 million customers in the Bay Area (including the 867,000 residents of San Francisco) via a gravity-fed siphon system. Embedded in this system are 384.5 MW of hydroelectric generation capacity and 11 MW of solar PV, wind, and biogas, which supplies 100% of electricity used by San Francisco municipal buildings and infrastructure, including water and wastewater treatment.

","Fleet Policies and Composition

San Jose’s Green Fleet Policy guides staff through vehicle procurement and requires consideration of alternative fuel options to reduce carbon emissions.  The City’s current plan is to replace internal combustion engine vehicles in the light duty fleet (except PD & Fire) with EVs as they become due for retirement, if a suitable EV solution exists. The Electric Mobility Roadmap proposes that the City replace all 89 of its non-police sedans that are more than 10 years old with EVs in the next two years. Doing so would make 98% of the non-police sedans plug-in electric, and 69% fully electric. In support of this strategy, the City Council directed the Fleet Division to perform a life-cycle cost analysis of replacing all non-electric fleet vehicles with electric vehicles within the next five years where technologically feasible. San Jose’s municipal fleet is composed of 25% efficient vehicles hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles.

Public Lighting

San José’s Department of Transportation follows and references IES’ roadway guide for practice but there is no formal adoption of this or the Model Lighting Ordinance for streetlights or outdoor lighting. The Public Streetlight Design Guide, adopted in February 2011, has a goal to replace 100% of streetlights with zero-emission lighting. Voter approval of Measure T (The Disaster Preparedness, Public Safety and Infrastructure Bond) in November 2018 is allowing the Departments of Transportation (DOT) and Public Works (DPW) to implement a complete conversion of the City’s remaining outdoor lighting inventory to LEDs. In partnership with PG&E, the City’s streetlight and outdoor park/facility lights will be converted to LEDs. LED lighting and controls upgrades will capture additional energy savings and GHG reductions. As of 2023, approximately 95% of the City's streetlights have been converted to LEDs.

","Building Benchmarking

Through its Energy and Water Building Performance Ordinance, the City is required to benchmark and disclose data on municipal buildings that are 15,000 square feet or larger. This totals 85% of municipal square footage. San José currently benchmarks 88% of its municipal buildings over 10,000 square feet.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategy

The city contracted with an ESCO provider to help identify and implement energy efficiency efforts on municipal buildings, and the ESCO agreement scope of work was completed in 2019. The passage of the Energy and Water Building Performance Ordinance will provide an opportunity to create a retrocommissioning strategy once portfolio-wide findings are complete. Additionally, one- and five-year Capital Improvement Plans for city facilities managed by the Public Works Department are being developed and will include energy efficiency projects as appropriate. In 2020 the city council passed an ordinance to limit natural gas infrastructure in new buildings. Energy efficiency principles have been incorporated into existing workflows and programs. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning projects completed at the Shirakawa Community Center and the San José Museum of Art utilized energy efficient equipment to replace inefficient and troublesome end-of-life equipment. This upgrade work will continue through the City's Deferred Maintenance Infrastructure Backlog (DMIB) program.

Municipal Employee Transportation Benefits 

San Jose provides a VTA SmartPass to all benefitted employees that allows free travel on all local VTA buses and light rail trains. Express buses have half of the fare covered.

","Overview

The State of California allows its local jurisdictions to adopt building energy codes that are more stringent than the mandatory state codes. Title 24 outlines all California building codes. Title 24, Part 6 includes the California Energy Code and the California Building Energy Efficiency Standards (BEES). Title 24, Part 11 includes the California Green Building Code. The 2022 codes exceed the 2021 IECC standards and ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-2018. To learn more about California’s building energy codes, please visit the State Policy Database. 

San José's Reach Code was updated in October 2022 to align with the most recent state building code cycle and uses the the EDR compliance pathway (see explanation below under Residential). Under San José’s Reach Code, all new residential construction for single-family, low-rise multifamily, and detached accessory dwelling units (ADUs) must meet all-electric efficiency requirements of the 2022 California Building Energy Code (Base Code), or mixed-fuel must meet a minimum 10 point EDR reduction from the Base Code with electrification readiness. A hardship exemption may be provided for permanent supportive housing and housing built for 30% local area median income. 

Commercial 

Commercial buildings must meet the requirements of San Jose's reach code and natural gas ban. The city’s zEPI score for their commercial energy code is 41.

Residential 

Residential buildings must meet the requirements of San José's reach code and natural gas ban. The city’s zEPI score for their residential energy code is 26.

In 2019, California energy codes (Title 24) adopted the Energy Design Rating (EDR) compliance pathway. EDR is similar to ERI in that the reference home is a score of 100 with every percentage of energy reduced representing a score reduction of one point; for more information please visit RESNET. 

Solar-readiness policies 

San José adheres to the 2022 California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential Buildings, which requires solar photovoltaic systems for single-family, multifamily, and nonresidential buildings. Additionally, San José’s Reach Code requires solar readiness for all building types, covering any that may not be covered by the 2022 Standards. 

EV-charging readiness policies

San José's Reach Code also includes EV requirements that apply to new residential, multifamily, and commercial building construction starting January 1, 2020. New single-family and ADUs must provide 1 EV Ready space per dwelling. New low-rise and high-rise multi-family residential must provide 10% Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE), 20% EV Ready, and 70% EV Capable of all parking spaces required by Code (spaces). Hotel/Motel must provide 10% EVSE, and 50% EV Capable spaces. All new non-residential construction must provide 10% EVSE and 40% EV Capable spaces.    

Low-energy use requirements

Council Policy 6-32 requires commercial projects of more than 25,000 square feet but less than 75 feet in height to be LEED Silver certified. Residential developments less than 10 units are required to complete a GreenPoint or LEED Checklist. Residential developments greater than 10 units are required to be GreenPoint Rated at 50 points or be LEED Certified.

City-Led Efforts to Decarbonize the Electric Grid

San José Clean Energy (SJCE) supplies power to the majority of San José residents and businesses, nearly 330,000 customers (less than 1.5% of customers opted to remain with PG&E). As of March 2021, SJCE serves over 345,000 customers and maintains a participation rate of about 98%. The current power mix for SJCE’s default service, GreenSource, supplies customers with about 40% renewable and 92% carbon free electricity. Customers can also upgrade to TotalGreen to power their home or business with 100% renewable and carbon-free energy. As of March 2021, about 1,100 accounts are enrolled in TotalGreen. SJCE estimates its customer demand for renewable energy will total 2,000 GWh annually by 2022. To meet customer demand, SJCE has contracted for nearly 500 MW of new renewable energy and 10 MW of battery storage since 2019, with two projects planned to come online by the end of 2021 and two by the end of 2022.

","Citywide Water Efficiency and Goals

The San José Municipal Water System offers free water fixtures for its San Jose customers, including showerheads and kitchen and bathroom faucet aerators, and has also started to partner with PG&E to increase conservation efforts. PG&E also offers rebates for high-efficiency commercial dishwashers.

San José Municipal Water System (Muni Water) continues to implement water efficiency practices and new technologies that meet and exceed its water savings goals for multiple agencies and programs. For example, Muni Water has already met and exceeded its California SB-X7-7 2020 goal of 145 gallons per capita per day (GPCD) by reaching 126 GPCD in 2015. This is monitored and tracked through each retailer's Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP). Muni Water is also actively working towards reaching California’s recently passed AB-1668 bill calling for an indoor residential water usage of 50 GPCD in 2030. Muni Water is working towards that goal in conjunction with Climate Smart San José, which sets the residential GPCD target to 42 GPCD by 2030. Water-efficient practices continue to remain in place and new technologies are being implemented to continue the reduction of water use to meet these goals.

San José Municipal Water System continues to implement its enhanced water conservation outreach efforts. San Jose’s General Plan also outlines specific water savings targets, which include reducing citywide per capita water consumption by 25% by 2040 below 2010 levels and achieving 50 million gallons per day of water conservation savings in San Jose, by reducing water use and increasing water-use efficiency by 2040.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

Although there is not an energy efficiency goal established for municipal water service operations, the wastewater utility has implemented a number of energy efficiency measures, including installing more efficient fine bubble diffusers in its aeration tanks, as well as practicing pulsed, or episodic aeration, both of which significantly reduce energy demands for the aeration process. The wastewater utility has also installed LED streetlights throughout its 170-acre campus, and it continues to evaluate additional energy conservation measures. In addition, the wastewater utility is undergoing a $1.4 billion, 10-year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) to rehabilitate and upgrade the entire treatment process for greater energy efficiency and reliability. The CIP has plans to invest in energy efficiency projects including $36.4 million aeration tanks rehabilitation and blower improvement projects which will reduce up to 40% of kWh and $1 million annually in secondary treatment once these projects are completed. San José Municipal Water System also aims to purchase 100% carbon-free power by the end of 2021 and install solar systems by 2025.

In 2022, the San Jose-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility (RWF) generated about 78% of its power needs in-house through the capture and use of digester gas and the combustion of natural gas. In addition, the wastewater facility captures waste heat from the engines to keep digesters warm for the optimal operation of the digestion process, adding to overall energy efficiency.

Low-Income Programs 



The state of Massachusetts is served by the Low-Income Energy Affordability Network (LEAN), which is a network of Community Action Agencies, public and private housing owners, government organizations and public utilities that work together to provide low-income efficiency solutions in the state. Through LEAN, Eversource and Columbia Gas of Massachusetts participate in the dual fuel Income Eligible Coordinated Delivery Core Initiative (formerly Low-Income Single Family and Low-Income Multi-Family), which serves customers at or below 60% of the state median income level for 1–4-unit buildings or buildings with 5+ units that have 50% of units are at or below 60% AMI. The initiative offers no cost measures such as lighting and smart strips, appliance replacement, water saving measures, insulation and air sealing, and heating system replacement.  



The program serves all income eligible customers that meet the program guidelines. Customers typically qualify for fuel assistance and other qualifying government assistance programs and the utility Discount Rate. Customers with a high WAP score and high energy burden are given priority. The initiative is implemented by local Community Action Program (CAP) Agencies and is integrated with the Department of Housing and Community Development’s (DHCD) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). There is also a statewide Energy Efficiency Advisory Council and an Income Eligible Best Practices Committee that provide guidance on income eligible utility-sponsored programs in the state.  



Customers typically qualify for fuel assistance and other qualifying government assistance programs and the utility Discount Rate. Customers with a high WAP score and high energy burden are given priority. CAP agencies leverage additional funding from the Department of Energy and DHCD for heating systems and health and safety repairs. CAPs leverage utility funds and WAP funds for repairs of health and safety measures such as knob and tube removal, asbestos removal, combustion safety, mold and moisture remediation, roof repair, pest remediation and others. Additionally, the City of Boston Credit Union became a Mass Save HEAT Loan Participating Lender by offering customers the opportunity to apply for 0% loans for the installation of qualified energy efficient improvements. 



In 2021, according to Eversource, it achieved 142,842 MWh in energy savings, while spending $30,567,314 on its low-income programs and serving 12,366 low-income customers. Data on spending, savings, and customers served for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts in 2021 was not available.  



Multifamily Programs 



Eversource offers a Residential Coordinated Delivery initiative, which includes services to single-family homes, including free-standing town homes, smaller multi-unit buildings, such as those with three stories or less, and larger multi-unit buildings, such as those with four stories or more, or with a centralized heating system. It offers energy assessments that identify all cost-effective efficiency improvement or replacement opportunities regardless of fuel source for market rate properties with four or more dwellings. Utilizing a “whole facility” approach, the assessments focus on a facility's thermal envelope (shell insulation and air leakage conditions) as well as lighting and mechanical systems. The program also assesses in-unit savings potential for tenants. Improvements that may be eligible for incentives include lighting upgrades/controls, occupancy sensors, water heating equipment, domestic hot water measures, programmable thermostats, insulation, air sealing, heating and cooling equipment upgrades/controls, ENERGY STAR appliances and other improvements as determined on a site-specific basis. Eligible measures for the program include insulation, air sealing, light fixtures, and hot water and heating equipment, as well as heating and cooling equipment, air compressors, and energy management systems. 



In 2019, according to Eversource, it achieved 12,610 Net Annual MWh Savings , while spending $16,315,962 in incentives on its multifamily programs and served 11,082 housing units. 



Columbia Gas of Massachusetts offers a Multifamily Buildings program, which provides whole building retrofits and partial payment for energy efficiency measure to units. Eligible measures include insulation, heating system replacement, air sealing, showerheads, and aerators. Savings, spending, and participation data for 2021 was not available.

In 2019, National Grid and NYSERDA spent $143,193,382 on energy efficiency programs for National Grid customers, which represents 6.57% of its retail revenue.

In 2019, National Grid and NYSERDA reported 29.34 MMtherms of net natural gas savings at the meter for National Grid customers, which represents 1.88% of its natural gas retail sales across the utility’s service territory. In 2019, National Grid spent $27,687,252 on natural gas energy efficiency, which equates to $15.43 per residential customer.

NYSERDA offers the EmPower New York program to qualified low-income residential National Grid customers. This program addresses both electric and natural gas end uses, while providing no-cost energy efficiency solutions including air sealing, insulation, replacement of inefficient refrigerators and freezers, water efficiency measures, thermostats, and new energy-efficient lighting in order to reduce energy consumption. Additionally, the EmPower program includes health and safety checks of smoke detectors and appliances. Households that receive HEAP benefits, utility bill payment assistance, or participate in the federal Weatherization Assistance Program are automatically eligible. NYSERDA’s Multifamily Performance Program and RetrofitNY initiatives also have low-income saving components. See the next section for more information.

In 2019, NSYERDA’s low-income programs achieved 3,031 MWh and 0.85 MMtherms savings for National Grid’s service territory while serving 4,555 low-income customers.

Multifamily Programs

NYSERDA’s Multifamily Performance Program provides incentives for owners to incorporate energy efficiency into affordable buildings for National Grid customers. A Multifamily Building Solutions Provider will work with the owner to evaluate the building’s systems holistically, creating a customized plan aimed at generating a minimum of 20% source energy savings along with reduced energy bills. For projects that could reach deeper energy savings, the High-Performance Component targets a minimum of 40% source energy savings with a maximum post-construction source energy use intensity (EUI) of 100 kBtu/sq ft./yr.

In 2018, NYSERDA launched the RetrofitNY initiative. The goal of this program is to drive market transformation by industrializing and standardizing the design and construction processes to achieve deep levels of cost compression, which will drive large-scale adoption of deep energy and net-zero retrofits in multifamily buildings. RetrofitNY approaches retrofits from a whole building perspective and targets multiple health and resiliency benefits as associated outcomes of building work-scope. NYSERDA funds are used in conjunction with other subsidies and financing offered from local, state, and federal sources as a financing package coordinated through relevant affordable housing agencies.   

In addition to NYSERDA programs, National Grid offers a multifamily program that provides no-cost direct install of high-efficiency showerheads, faucet aerators and thermostatic radiator valves. It also provides rebates for high-efficiency natural gas heating and water heating, insulation, programmable thermostats, boiler reset controls, steam traps and custom efficiency measures.

Climate Mitigation Goal

The Sustainable DC Plan established a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80% below 2006 levels by 2050, with an interim reduction goal of 50% below 2006 levels by 2032. The District’s 2050 goal was updated in 2017 when Mayor Bowser committed the District achieving citywide carbon neutrality by 2050. To meet these goals, Washington must reduce per capita emissions by 2.78% annually. Based on ACEEE’s analysis of past years emissions data, ACEEE projects that the city will meet its near-term GHG emissions reduction goal for municipal operations.  

Energy Reduction Goal

The Sustainable DC Plan included a goal to reduce citywide energy use 50% below 2012 levels by 2032. The District also participates in the Better Buildings Challenge to achieve an interim energy use reduction goal of 20% below 2012 levels by 2022. The plan also calls for the city to undertake and complete a strategic energy plan for reducing energy and water use across the Department of General Services' portfolio and implement a deep energy retrofit program across 9% of the DC Government building stock by 2024, prioritizing those buildings whose core systems and equipment are nearing the end of their useful life. These goals were codified in the Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act. To achieve these goals, the District must reduce energy use per capita by 3.3% annually. 

Renewable Energy Goal

DC City Council has approved a citywide 100% renewable portfolio standard by 2032, including 5.5% from local solar. The share of local solar will increase to 10% by 2041. 

Last updated: May 2021
","Fleet Policies and Composition

The Climate Commitment Act of 2022 requires only zero-emission vehicle purchases and leases for District Government vehicles starting 1/1/2026. The Department of Public Works' procurement policy is to require all new sedans be all-electric or PHEV. For other vehicle types, the District has standardized the vehicle makes and models for alternative fuels and requires the most fuel efficiency standards for other ICE engines. The Department of Energy & Environment is leading the development of a Transportation Electrification Roadmap, to meet the goals outlined in the Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act. The Fleet Management Administration recently launched a multi-year effort to install 20 dual-port charging stations to support electrification of the fleet. The District’s Clean Energy DC Omnibus Act (section 502) requires all public buses to be zero-emission vehicles by 2045. Furthermore, it requires the District’s Department of Transportation to submit a plan for achieving 100% replacement of public buses, including school buses, with electric buses upon the end of their useful life, by calendar year 2021. Washington’s fleet is composed of 13.7% efficient vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles.

Public Lighting

Washington has not adopted a policy requiring efficient outdoor lighting, such as the International Dark-Sky Association’s Model Lighting Ordinance. The District is launching a Streetlight Upgrade and Modernization Project which proposes to convert the street light network of more than 75,000 assets to light-emitting diode (LED) technology with remote monitoring and control capabilities. In addition to conversion, poles will be brought up to a “state of good repair,” meaning that arms, bases, and poles that are in disrepair (i.e., chipped paint, leaning, or broken) will be repaired to and maintained at fair condition. The proposed improvements would occur primarily within the existing right-of-way. The District of Columbia Office of Public-Private Partnerships (OP3) is providing procurement support as the selected bidder is expected to use private financing to develop the project. As of October 2023, approximately 48.5% of public lighting has been upgraded to LEDs.

Inclusive procurement 

The District has contracting and procurement policies that require spending benefit local and small businesses. District agencies are required to spend at least 50% of expendable budgets with such businesses, although these do not specifically give preference to minority-owned or women-owned businesses. DC released a 2022 Disparity Study, and has outlined a timeline for and begun to implement next steps.

","Building Benchmarking and Retrofitting

DC benchmarks all municipal buildings. The District requires all privately-owned buildings over 50,000 square feet, and District-owned or District instrumentality-owned buildings 10,000 square feet and larger to benchmark their energy and water use annually. For more information on benchmarking requirements for private buildings, please see the Buildings Policies section of the Local Policy Database.

Comprehensive Retrofit Strategies

Sustainable DC 2.0 calls on District Government to “retrofit and maintain all buildings owned by District Government to reduce energy use by 50% and maximize the installation of renewable energy technology.” Action EB.9 in the Clean Energy DC plan (released August 2018 and beginning implementation in 2019) calls on District government to lead in an aggressive deep energy retrofit program, followed by a net-zero retrofit program. Specifically the plan recommends phasing in an aggressive governmental building retrofit program over time, beginning with a deep energy retrofit process that covers 9% of District Government-owned buildings by square footage between 2021 and 2024, striving for an average of at least 30% reductions in energy and emissions, recognizing that that circumstances will vary by building, and different levels of reductions will be financially feasible and technically viable for different buildings. Following this initial sweep of deep energy retrofits, the plan calls for net-zero retrofits across 12.5% of the District Government building stock between 2026 and 2032. In 2020, the District began its launch of an Energy Savings Agreement (ESA) with an initial list of DC Public School pilot sites, targeting efficiency and water savings. The District’s Department of General Services completed its Energy Management Plan in 2022 and is currently working to implement changes toward meeting its codified targets.

Municipal Employee Transportation Benefits 

DC provides a free bikeshare membership to all DC government employees. Employees may also enroll in a Transit Commuter Benefits Account, allowing them to deduct up to $280 pre-tax each month for commuting expenses. The District does provide data on emissions from employee commutes; data can be found here.

The Sustainable DC plan updating process included speaking to residents that represented the diversity of the city. To make the process most convenient for residents of underserved communities, the city partnered with community organizations to help recruit new participants, held meetings in familiar Metro-accessible venues for communities, and restructured meeting formats to be more casual and accessible. The city also focused community engagement in locations that have been underserved in the past.

Equity-Driven Decision-Making

In partnership with the Georgetown Climate Center, the Department of Energy & Environment created the Equity Advisory Group. The Group consisted of residents and community leaders of Far Northeast Ward 7, where a climate vulnerability analysis showed the community has been uniquely vulnerable to climate-risks due to its proximity to the Watts Branch Tributary of the Anacostia River. The Group was tasked with developing recommendation to be incorporated into the District’s Climate Ready DC Plan and Clean Energy DC Plan. The partnership published a community engagement guide. Work is now underway to focus on developing resilience hubs and workforce development initiatives based on the advisory group’s recommendations.

Equity Accountability Measures

The Racial Equity Achieves Results Act (REACH Act) of 2020 established a new Office of Racial Equity, led by a new Chief Equity Officer, creates a racial equity impact assessment for Council legislation, trains all government employees on racial equity, creates a racial equity tool to ensure District government is accountable, and establishes a Commission to advance racial equity. The Office of Racial Equity will focus on developing an infrastructure to ensure policy decisions and District programs are evaluated through an equity lens. The Chief Equity Officer will collaborate with District agencies, residents, and external stakeholders to make meaningful progress toward a more equitable city. Among the first responsibilities of the Chief Equity Officer will be to conduct an equity analysis of the District to establish government-wide priorities and to build a team to support the implementation of these priorities.

The District Department of Energy and Environment (DOEE) is developing a racial equity tool in the implementation and future update of the District’s Sustainable DC plan.

Construction Code includes the Energy Conservation Code which is more stringent than the 2015 IECC and ASHRAE 90.1-2013. The Construction Code also includes the Green Construction Code which is based on the 2012 International Green Construction Code. The next update to the codes was initiated in February 2022, with a goal of enacting them in early 2024. To learn more about the District of Columbia’s required energy codes, please visit the State Policy Database.

Commercial

Commercial properties comply with the 2017 D.C. Construction Code, which consist of the 2015 International Code Council (ICC) family of model codes, the 2014 National Electrical Code, and 2013 ASHRAE 90.1, as amended by the District of Columbia Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Title 12, Sections A through M. This includes Appendix Z, a voluntary net-zero energy compliance pathway. To comply with Appendix Z, commercial projects must demonstrate a zEPI score of 30 or lower. The city’s zEPI score for their commercial energy code is 50.25.

Residential 

Residential buildings comply with the 2017 D.C. Construction Code. The city’s zEPI score for their residential energy code is 62.4.

Solar-readiness policies 

The 2017 DC Construction Codes include a solar-ready requirement for new commercial developments and major alterations or additions. 

 

EV-charging readiness policies 

The Electric Vehicle Readiness Amendment Act of 2019 was signed in 2021 and will require 20% of parking spaces in newly constructed or substantially renovated commercial or multi-unit buildings include EV-ready infrastructure. The Green Construction Code also includes a compliance path with an elective encouraging installation of EV charging infrastructure.

 

Low-energy use requirements


The Green Construction Code applies to all commercial projects 10,000 square feet and larger, and all residential projects 4 stories and higher and 10,000 square feet or larger. The Green Building Act requires that a commercial building over 50,000 square feet must achieve LEED at the Certified level. If a commercial or residential building has received at least 15% of its funding from public sources (broadly defined to include ground leases, TIF districts, etc.) they must achieve Green Communities Certification (residential), LEED at the Silver level (nonresidential), or LEED at the Gold level (Schools). New municipal buildings must achieve LEED Gold or ENERGY STAR 75+ standards. 

Electrification

The Building Code Amendment Act of 2022 (DC B24-0420) mandates a net-zero energy and all-electric energy code be adopted by the District by December 31, 2026. 

Last update: August 2023

","The District’s Department of Consumer & Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) is responsible for regulating construction in the District, including enforcing the District’s Green Building Act, Green Construction Code, and Energy Conservation Code. DCRA requires plan reviews and inspections for projects, and also allows third-party energy review and inspection with a clear QA/QC process to ensure quality control. The project size determines if performance testing and commissioning is required to meet compliance. We were unable to determine the amount of staff effort dedicated to energy code enforcement. 

The District offers upfront support to projects and developers, including on code compliance, solar, and NZE construction, through webinars, online resources, and a Green Building Professional Seminar Series hosted in partnership with the Department of Energy & Environment.

DCSEU offers programs that include incentives for water saving measures like water heaters, thermostatically initiated shower restriction valves, and efficient clothes washers. The District of Columbia offers water efficiency programs separately from the energy utilities. The District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DC Water) developed the award-winning High Usage Notification Application (HUNA) as a free service to proactively notify customers of high-water use - including unknown household leaks, sprinklers accidentally left running, or ruptured washing machine hoses.

Sustainable DC 2.0 established a goal to decrease potable water consumption by 20% from a 2012 baseline by the end of 2032. The 2021 Sustainable DC progress report shows a 19.4% reduction in per catia water consumption.  Supporting actions include updating the District’s building codes to increase water-efficiency standards and allow the use of alternative water systems, developing incentives for water-efficiency measure in landscaping and buildings, and piloting water efficiency projects in District Government buildings to lead by example. DC Water is committed to protecting and preserving the national and local water supply through encouraging water-efficient practices, products, and services. By partnering with the EPA’s WaterSense program, DC Water will offer consumers useful water-saving techniques and encourage them to look for WaterSense labeled products, when making product choices. These products use about 20% less water and perform as well as, or better than, conventional models. Supporting actions include updating the District’s building codes to increase water-efficiency standards and allow the use of alternative water systems, developing incentives for water-efficiency measure in landscaping and buildings, and piloting water efficiency projects in District Government buildings to lead by example. Progress toward the Sustainable DC 2.0 goal is included in the annual progress report.

Water Plant Efficiency and Self-Generation

DC Water has pursued several projects to reduce energy used for wastewater treatment. It has systematically retrofitted diffuser equipment at the Blue Plains treatment to significantly reduce energy consumed through the treatment process. It has also been improving tidal gates on an ongoing basis to reduce infiltration and water treatment volume. DC Water operates an anaerobic digester to generate electricity and steam from solid waste. The energy facility at the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant uses the solids left over at the end of the wastewater treatment process to create electricity and steam. The project reduces the energy needs of the massive plant by about a third. DC Water expects to expand the capacity and efficiency of the system to meet even more of its energy load in the near future. The Bioenergy facility opened in 2015. It uses thermal hydrolysis to maximize anaerobic digestion.  DC Water also operates a wastewater-sourced thermal energy system at its headquarters In FY22, renewable energy provided 43 percent of DC Water's total energy use. This was made possible, in part, by the Phase 1 Solar Program at Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant.

The program serves all income eligible customers that meet the program guidelines. Customers typically qualify for fuel assistance and other qualifying government assistance programs and the utility Discount Rate. Customers with a high WAP score and high energy burden are given priority. The initiative is implemented by local Community Action Program (CAP) Agencies and is integrated with the Department of Housing and Community Development’s (DHCD) Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP). There is also a statewide Energy Efficiency Advisory Council and an Income Eligible Best Practices Committee that provide guidance on income eligible utility-sponsored programs in the state.

Customers typically qualify for fuel assistance and other qualifying government assistance programs and the utility Discount Rate. Customers with a high WAP score and high energy burden are given priority. CAP agencies leverage additional funding from the Department of Energy and DHCD for heating systems and health and safety repairs. CAPs leverage utility funds and WAP funds for repairs of health and safety measures such as knob and tube removal, asbestos removal, combustion safety, mold and moisture remediation, roof repair, pest remediation and others.

In 2019, according to National Grid, it achieved 15,646 MWh energy savings, while spending $33,370,919 on its low-income electric programs and served 9,259 electric low-income customers.

Multifamily Programs

Both Eversource and National Grid the Residential Coordinated Delivery initiative, which includes services to single-family homes, including free-standing town homes, smaller multi-unit buildings, such as those with three stories or less, and larger multi-unit buildings, such as those with four stories or more, or with a centralized heating system. It offers energy assessments that identify all cost-effective efficiency improvement or replacement opportunities regardless of fuel source for market rate properties with four or more dwellings. Utilizing a “whole facility” approach, the assessments focus on a facility's thermal envelope (shell insulation and air leakage conditions) as well as lighting and mechanical systems. The program also assesses in-unit savings potential for tenants. Improvements that may be eligible for incentives include lighting upgrades/controls, occupancy sensors, water heating equipment, domestic hot water measures, programmable thermostats, insulation, air sealing, heating and cooling equipment upgrades/controls, ENERGY STAR appliances and other improvements as determined on a site-specific basis. Eligible measures for the program include insulation, air sealing, light fixtures, and hot water and heating equipment, as well as heating and cooling equipment, air compressors, and energy management systems.

Additionally, these utilities offer the Low Income Multi-Family Energy Retrofits Program. This program provides eligible projects the use of an online tool to benchmark a development/building’s energy use for one year, two building assessments to identify energy-saving opportunities (including electrical and heating audits, and installation of eligible cost-effective energy conservation measures. Eversource and National Grid also offer the Multi-Family Retrofit program, which offers multifamily energy assessments that identify all energy efficiency opportunities regardless of fuel source. The program focuses on multi-family dwellings with 5 or more units on a property. The program also addresses problems associated with mixed-use buildings. Eligible measures for the program include insulation, air sealing, light fixtures, and hot water and heating equipment, as well as heating and cooling equipment, air compressors, and energy management systems.

In 2019, according to National Grid, it achieved 19,181 MWh in energy savings. National Grid’s spending and participation data was not available. In 2019, according to Eversource, it saved 0.60 MMtherms, while spending $7,847,943 on its multifamily gas programs and serving 13,900 multifamily housing units.
